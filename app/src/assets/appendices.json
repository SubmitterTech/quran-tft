The Simple Facts are those observations that can be \nascertained without using any tools. The complex facts require the assistance of a \ncalculator  or  a  computer.  The  following  facts  do  not  require  any  tools  to  be \nverified, but please remember they all refer to the original Arabic text: \n\n1.  The first verse (1:1), known as \u201cBasmalah\u201d consists of........... 19 letters. \n2.  The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is ................................ 19 x 6. \n3.  The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or ................ 19 x 334. \n\n[6234 numbered verses & 112 un-numbered verses \n(Basmalahs) 6234 + 112 = 6346] Note that 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = ...... 19. \n\n4.  The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous \n\nabsence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) & 114 =....... 19 x 6. \n\n5.  From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra \n\nBasmalah of Sura 27, there are precisely ................................. 19 suras. \n\n6.  It follows that the total of the sura numbers \n\nfrom 9 to 27 (9 +10 +11 +12 +... + 26 + 27) is 342, or .............. 19 x 18. \n\n7.  This total (342) also equals the number of words \n\nbetween the two Basmalahs of Sura 27, and 342 =.................. 19 x 18. \n8.  The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of........................ 19 words. \n9.  This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters................ 19 x 4. \n10.  Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of .......... 19 verses. \n11.  This first chronological sura is placed atop the last ................. 19 suras. \n12.  Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters, and 304 equals ............. 19 x 16. \n13.  The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of................................. 19 words. \n14.  The first verse of the last revelation (110:1) consists of ........... 19 letters. \n15.  14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of \n\n\u201cQuranic Initials\u201d (such as A.L.M. of 2:1), and prefix \n29 suras. These numbers add up to 14 + 14 + 29 = 57 = .......... 19 x 3. \n\n16.  The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic \nInitials occur is 2 + 3 + 7 +... + 50 + 68 = 822, and \n822 + 14 (14 sets of initials) equals 836, or ............................... 19 x 44. \n\n17.  Between the first initialed sura (Sura 2) and the last \n\ninitialed sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras............. 19 x 2. \n18.  Between the first and last initialed sura there are..................... 19 sets \n\nof alternating \u201cinitialed\u201d and \u201cuninitialed\u201d suras. \n\n19.

            "1": "378 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nHistorical Background \n\nIn 1968, I realized that the existing English translations of the Quran did not \npresent  the  truthful  message  of  God\u2019s  Final  Testament.  For  example,  the  two  \nmost  popular  translators,  Yusuf  Ali  and  Marmaduke  Pickthall,  could  not  over-\ncome  their  corrupted  religious  traditions  when  it  came  to  the  Quran\u2019s  great \ncriterion in 39:45. \n\nWhen God ALONE is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in \nthe  Hereafter  shrink  with  aversion.  But  when  others  are mentioned  beside \nHim, they rejoice.      [39:45] \n\nYusuf  Ali  omitted  the  crucial  word  \u201cALONE\u201d  from  his  translation,  and  al-\ntered  the  rest  of  the  verse  by  inserting  the  word  \u201c(gods).\u201d  Thus,  he  utterly \ndestroyed this most important Quranic criterion. He translated 39:45 as follows: \n\nWhen God, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe \nnot  in  the  Hereafter  are  filled  with  disgust  and  horror;  but  when  (gods) \nother than He are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy. \n           [39:45] \n(according to A. Yusuf Ali) \n\nThe  expression  \u201cWhen  God,  the  One  and  Only,  is  mentioned,\u201d  is  not  the   \nsame  as  saying,  \u201cWhen  God  alone  is  mentioned.\u201d  One  can  mention  \u201cGod,  the  \nOne  and  Only,\u201d  and  also  mention  Muhammad  or  Jesus,  and  no  one  will  be    \nupset. But if \u201cGod ALONE is mentioned,\u201d you cannot mention anyone else, and  \na  lot  of  people\u2014those  who  idolize  Muhammad  or  Jesus\u2014will  be  upset.  Thus, \nYusuf Ali could not bring himself to present the truth of the Quran, if it exposed \nhis corrupted belief. \n\nMarmaduke  Pickthall  translated  \u201cALONE\u201d  correctly,  but  destroyed  the \ncriterion  by  inserting  his  personal  belief  in  parentheses;  he  translated  39:45  as \nfollows: \n\nAnd when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in \nthe Hereafter are repelled, and when those (whom they worship) beside Him \nare mentioned, behold! they are glad.                                                 [39:45]   \n(according to Marmaduke Pickthal) \n\nWhen I saw the truth of God\u2019s word thus distorted, I decided to translate the \nQuran,  at  least  for  the  benefit  of  my  own  children.  Since  I  was  a  chemist  by \nprofession,  and  despite  my  extensive  religious  background\u2014my  father  was  a \nrenowned Sufi leader in Egypt\u2014I vowed to God that I would not move from one \nverse to the next unless I fully understood it. \n\nI purchased all the available books of Quranic translations and exegeses (Taf-\nseer)  I  could  find,  placed  them  on  a  large  table,  and  began  my  translation.  The \nfirst  sura,  The  Key,  was  completed  in  a  few  days.  The  first  verse  in  Sura  2  is \n\u201cA.L.M.\u201d  The  translation  of  this  verse  took  four  years,  and  coincided  with  the \ndivine unveiling of \u201cthe secret,\u201d the great mathematical Miracle of the Quran. \n\nThe  books  of  Quranic  exegeses  unanimously  agreed  that  \u201cno  one  knows  the \nmeaning or significance of the Quranic Initials A.L.M., or any other initials.\u201d I \n\n\f"

            "1": "Appendix 1 \n\n379 \n\ndecided to write the Quran into the computer, analyze the whole text, and see if \nthere were any mathematical correlations among these Quranic initials. \n\nI used a time-share terminal, connected by telephone to a giant computer. To \ntest my hypothesis, I decided to look at the single-lettered Quranic Initials\u2014\u201cQ\u201d \n(Qaaf) of Suras 42 and 50, \u201cS\u201d (Saad) of Suras 7, 19, and 38, and \u201cN\u201d (Noon) of \nSura  68.  As  detailed  in  my  first  book  MIRACLE  OF  THE  QURAN:  SIG-\nNIFICANCE  OF  THE  MYSTERIOUS  ALPHABETS  (Islamic  Productions,    \n1973), many previous attempts to unravel the mystery had failed. \n\nThe Quranic Initial \u201cQ\u201d (Qaaf) \nThe computer data showed that the text of the only Q-initialed suras, 42 and \n50, contained the same number of Q\u2019s, 57 and 57. That was the first hint that a \ndeliberate mathematical system might exist in the Quran. \n\nSura 50 is entitled \u201cQ,\u201d prefixed with \u201cQ,\u201d and the first verse reads, \u201cQ, and \nthe  glorious  Quran.\u201d  This  indicated  that  \u201cQ\u201d  stands  for  \u201cQuran,\u201d  and  the  total \nnumber  of  Q\u2019s  in  the  two  Q-initialed  suras  represents  the  Quran\u2019s  114  suras       \n(57  +  57  =  114  =  19x6).  This  idea  was  strengthened  by  the  fact  that  \u201cthe     \nQuran\u201d occurs in the Quran 57 times. \n\nThe  Quran  is  described  in  Sura  \u201cQ\u201d  as  \u201cMajid\u201d  (glorious),  and  the  Arabic \n\nword \u201cMajid\u201d has a gematrical value of 57: M (40) + J (3) + I (10) +D (4) = 57. \n\nSura 42 consists of 53 verses, and 42 + 53 = 95 = 19x5. \nSura 50 consists of 45 verses, and 50 + 45 = 95, same total as in Sura 42. \n\nBy  counting  the  letter  \u201cQ\u201d  in  every  \u201cVerse  19\u201d  throughout  the  Quran,  the   \n\ntotal count comes to 76, 19x4. Here is a summary of the Q-related data: \n\n1. The frequency of occurrence of \u201cQ\u201d in Sura \u201cQ\u201d (No. 50) is 57, 19x3. \n2. The letter \u201cQ\u201d occurs in the other Q-initialed sura (No. 42) exactly the     same \nnumber of times, 57. \n3. The  total  occurrence  of  the  letter  \u201cQ\u201d  in  the  two  Q-initialed  suras  is  114, \nwhich equals the number of suras in the Quran. \n4. \u201cThe Quran\u201d is mentioned in the Quran 57 times. \n5. The  description  of  the  Quran  as  \u201cMajid\u201d  (Glorious)  is  correlated  with  the \nfrequency  of  occurrence of  the  letter  \u201cQ\u201d  in  each of  the  Q-initialed  suras.  The \nword \u201cMajid\u201d has a gematrical value of 57. \n7. Sura 42 consists of 53 verses, and 42 + 53 is 95, or 19x5. \n8. Sura 50 consists of 45 verses, and 50 + 45 is also 95, 19x5. \n9. The number of Q\u2019s in all verses numbered \u201c19\u201d throughout the Quran is 76, \n19x4. \n\nGlimpses of the Quran\u2019s mathematical composition began to emerge. For ex-\nample, it was observed that the people who disbelieved in Lot are mentioned in \n50:13 and occur in the Quran 13 times\u20147:80; 11:70, 74, 89; 21:74; 22:43; 26:160; \n27:54,  56;  29:28;  38:13;  50:13;  and  54:33.  Consistently,  they  are  referred  to  as \n\u201cQawm,\u201d with the single exception of the Q-initialed Sura 50 where they are \n\n \n\f"

            "1": "380 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nreferred  to  as  \u201cIkhwaan.\u201d  Obviously,  if  the  regular,  Q-containing  word  \u201cQawm\u201d     \nwere  used,  the  count  of  the  letter  \u201cQ\u201d  in  Sura  50  would  have  become  58,  and      \nthis  whole  phenomenon  would  have  disappeared.  With  the  recognized  absolute \naccuracy of mathematics, the alteration of a single letter destroys the system. \n\nAnother  relevant  example  is  the  reference  to  Mecca  in  3:96  as  \u201cBecca\u201d!  This \nstrange  spelling  of  the  renowned  city  has  puzzled  Islamic  scholars  for  many  cen- \nturies.  Although  Mecca  is  mentioned  in  the  Quran  properly  spelled  in  48:24,  the    \nletter  \u201cM\u201d  is  substituted  with  a  \u201cB\u201d  in  3:96.  It  turns  out  that  Sura  3  is  an  M-ini-     \ntialed  sura,  and  the  count  of  the  letter  \u201cM\u201d  would  have  deviated  from  the     \nQuran\u2019s code if \u201cMecca\u201d was spelled correctly in 3:96. \n\nNuN (Noon) \n\nThis  initial  is  unique;  it  occurs  in  one  sura,  68,  and  the  name  of  the  letter  is   \nspelled  out  as  three  letters\u2014Noon  Wow  Noon\u2014in  the  original  text,  and  is  there-     \nfore  counted  as  two  N\u2019s.  The  total  count  of  this  letter  in  the  N-initialed  sura  is    \n133, 19x7. \n\nThe  fact  that  \u201cN\u201d  is  the  last  Quranic  Initial  (see  Table  1)  brings  out  a  number          \n\nof  special  observations.  For  example,  the  number  of  verses  from  the  first  Quranic   \nInitial (A.L.M. of 2:1) to the last initial (N. of 68:1) is 5263, or 19x277. \n\nThe  word  \u201cGod\u201d  (Allah)  occurs  2641  (19x139)  times  between  the  first  initial    \nand  the  last  initial.  Since  the  total  occurrence  of  the  word  \u201cGod\u201d  is  2698,  it  \nfollows that its occurrence outside the initials \u201cA.L.M.\u201d of 2:1 on one side, and \nthe  initial  \u201cN\u201d  of  68:1  on  the  other  side,  is  57,    \n19x3.  Tables  9  to  20  prove  that  the  initial  \u201cNuN\u201d     \nmust be spelled out to show two N\u2019s. \n\nTable 2: The Frequency of \nOccurrence of the Letter \u201cS\u201d \nin the Saad-initialed Suras \n\nS (Saad) \n\nThis  initial  prefixes  three  suras,  7,  19,  and  38,   \nand  the  total  occurrence  of  the  letter  \u201cS\u201d  (Saad)       \nin  these  three  suras  is  152,  19x8  (Table  2).  It  is \nnoteworthy  that  in  7:69,  the  word  \u201cBastatan\u201d  is \nwritten  in  some  printings  with  a  \u201cSaad,\u201d  instead      \nof  \u201cSeen.\u201d  This  is  an  erroneous  distortion  that \nviolates the Quran\u2019s code. By looking at the  \noldest  available  copy  of  the  Quran,  the  Tashkent  Copy,  it  was  found  that  the  \nword  \u201cBastatan\u201d  is  correctly  written  with  a  \u201cSeen\u201d  (see  photocopy  below). \n\n      97 \n      26 \n      29 \n     152 \n   (19x8) \n\nSura \n  7   \n 19   \n 38   \n\nFrequency of \u201cS\u201d \n\nPhotocopy from the Tashkent Quran. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

The  Quran      \nwas  revealed  in  13  B.H.  (Before  Hijrah).  This  makes  the  number  of  years  from      \nthe  revelation  of  the  Quran  to  the  revelation  of  its  miracle  1393  +  13  =  1406  =   \n19x74.  As  noted  above,  the  unveiling  of  the  Miracle  took  place  in  January  1974.     \nThe  correlation  between  19x74  lunar  years  and  1974  solar  years  could  not  escape \nnotice.  This  is  especially  uncanny  in  view  of  the  fact  that  \u201c19\u201d  is  mentioned  in    \nSura 74. \n\nY.S. (Ya Seen) \n\nThese  two  letters  prefix  Sura  36.  The  letter  \u201cY\u201d  occurs  in  this  sura  237  times,  \nwhile  the  letter  \u201cS\u201d  (Seen)  occurs  48  times.  The  total  of  both  letters  is  285,  \n19x15. \n\nIt  is  noteworthy  that  the  letter  \u201cY\u201d  is  written  in  the  Quran  in  two  forms;  one          \nis  obvious  and  the  other  is  subtle.  The  subtle  form  of  the  letter  may  be  confusing        \nto  those  who  are  not  thoroughly\nample  is  the  word  \u201cAraany\nletter  \u201cY\u201d  is  used  twice  in  this  word,  the  first  \u201cY\u201d  is  subtle  and  the  second  is   \nobvious.  Sura  36  does  not  contain  a  single  \u201cY\u201d  of  the  subtle  type.  This  is  a \nremarkable  phenomenon,  and  one  that  does  not  normally  occur  in  a  long  sura           \nlike  Sura  36.  In  my  book  QURAN:  VISUAL  PRESENTATION  OF  THE  \nMIRACLE  (Islamic  Productions,  1982)  every  \u201cY\u201d  and  \u201cS\u201d  in  Sura  36  is  marked      \nwith a star. \n\nfamiliar  with  the  Arabic  language.

His  mission  is  to  purify  and  unify  all  existing  religions  into  one:  Islam  (Submission). \n\nIslam  is  NOT  a  name;  it  is  a  description  of  one’s  total  submission  and devotion  to  God  ALONE,  without  idolizing  Jesus,  Mary,  Muhammad,  or the  saints.  Anyone  who  meets  this  criterion  is  a  “Muslim”  (Submitter). Therefore,  one  may  be  a  Muslim  Jew,  a  Muslim  Christian,  a  Muslim Hindu, a Muslim Buddhist, or Muslim Muslim.\n\nGod’s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  delivers  God’s  proclamation  that  “The only  religion  approved  by  God  is  Submission”  (3:19)  and  that  “Anyone who  seeks  other  than  Submission  as  a  religion,  it  will  not  be  accepted from him/her” (3:85).\n\nA  messenger  of  God  must  present  proof  that  he  is  God’s  messenger.  Every messenger  of  God  is  supported  by  incontrovertible  divine  signs  proving that  he  is  authorized  by  the  Almighty  to  deliver  His  messages.  Moses  threw down  his  staff  and  it  turned  into  a  serpent,  Jesus  healed  the  leprous  and revived  the  dead  by  God’s  leave,  Saaleh’s  sign  was  the  famous  camel, Abraham  walked  out  of  the  fire,  and  Muhammad’s  miracle  was  the Quran (29:50-51). \n\nThe  Quran  (3:81,  33:7,  33:40)  and  the  Bible  (Malachi  3:1-3)  have prophesied  the  advent  of  the  consolidating  messenger,  God’s  Messenger  of the  Covenant.  It  is  only  befitting  that  a  messenger  with  such  a  crucial mission  must  be  supported  by  the  most  powerful  miracle  (74:30-35). While  the  miracles  of  previous  messengers  were  limited  in  time  and  place, God’s  miracle  supporting  His  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  is  perpetual;  it can be witnessed by anyone, at anytime, in any place. \n\nThis  Appendix  presents  physical,  examinable,  verifiable,  and  irrefutable evidence that Rashad Khalifa is God’s Messenger of the Covenant."

Six of these occurrences \nrefer  to  other  than  God  (one  kind  of  \nfood,  one  door,  etc.).  The  other  19  oc-\ncurrences  refer  to  God.  These  data  are \nfound  in  the  classic  reference  INDEX   \nTO THE WORDS OF QURAN. \n\nThe  crucial  importance  of  the \nword  \u201cONE\u201d  as  the  Quran\u2019s \nbasic  message  is  manifested  in \nthe  fact  that  the  Quran\u2019s  com-\nmon  denominator,  19,  happens \nto  be  the  gematrical  value  of \nthe word \u201cONE.\u201d \n\n        WHY   19! \n\nAs  pointed  out  later  in  this  Appendix,  all  God\u2019s  scriptures,  not  only  the  Quran, \nwere  mathematically  coded  with  the  number  \u201c19.\u201d  Even  the  universe  at  large   \nbears  this  divine  mark.  The  number  19  can  be  looked  upon  as  the  Almighty \nCreator\u2019s  signature  on  everything  He  created  (see  Appendix  38).  The  number   \n\u201c19\u201d  possesses  unique  mathematical  properties  beyond  the  scope  of  this  Appen-     \ndix. For example: \n\n[1] It is a prime number. \n\n[2] It encompasses the first numeral \nproclaim  God\u2019s  attribute  in  57:3  as    \nthe \u201cAlpha and the Omega.\u201d \n\n[3]  It  looks  the  same  in  all  languages \nof the world. Both components, 1 and \n9,  are  the  only  numerals  that  look  the \nsame in all languages. \n\n[4] It possesses many peculiar mathe-\nmatical properties. For example, 19 is \nthe sum of the first powers of 9 and \n10,  and  the  difference  between  the \nsecond powers of 9 and 10. \n\nWe  now  understand  that  the  uni-\nversal coding of God\u2019s creations with \nthe number  19 rests  in the  fact that it \nis  the  gematrical  value  of  the  word \nlan-\n\u201cONE\u201d \nguages\u2014Aramaic,  Hebrew,  and  Ara-\nbic. \n\nthe  scriptural \n\nin  all \n\nThe  number  19,  therefore,  pro-\nclaims  the  First  Commandment  in  all \nthe scriptures: that there is only ONE \nGod. \n\n(1) and the last numeral (9), as if to  \n\nThe Lord our God is ONE! \nTherefore, you shall worship \nthe Lord your God \nwith all your heart, \nwith all your soul, \nwith all your mind, \nand with all your strength. \n\n[Deuteronomy 6:4-5] \n[Mark 12:29] \n[Quran 2:163,17:22-23] \n\nTable 20: Why \u201c19!\u201d \n\n   Letter \n\n  Hebrew \n\nArabic       Value \n\nV \nA \nH \nD \n\n    W \n    A \n    H \n    D \n\n   6 \n   1 \n   8 \n   4 \n \u2026.. \n  19 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

The Contact Prayers \u201cSalat\u201d: \n\nThe  word  \u201cSalat\u201d  occurs  in  the  Quran  67  times,  and  when  we  add  the  num-      \n\nbers  of  suras  and  verses  of  these  67  occurrences,  the  total  comes  to  4674,  or \n19x246 (see INDEX OF THE QURAN). \n\n3. Fasting (Seyaam): \n\nThe  commandment  to  fast  is  mentioned  in  2:183,  184,  185,  187,  196;  4:92; \n5:89, 95;  33:35,  35; &  58:4.  The total  of  these  numbers  is  1387,  or  19x73.  It  is \nnoteworthy that 33:35 mentions fasting twice, one for the believing men, and the \nother for the believing women. \n4. The Obligatory Charity (Zakat):& \n5. Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca: \n\nWhile  the  first  three  \u201cPillars  of  Islam\u201d  are  obligatory  upon  all  Muslim  men  \nand women, the Zakat and Hajj are decreed only for those who can afford them. \nThis  explains  the  interesting  mathematical  phenomenon  associated  with  Zakat \nand Hajj. \n\nThe Zakat charity is mentioned in 2:43, 83, 110, 177, 277; 4:77, 162; 5:12, 55, \n7:156; 9:5, 11, 18, 71; 18:81; 19:13, 31, 55; 21:73; 22:41, 78; 23:4; 24:37, 56; 27:3; \n30:39; 31:4; 33:33; 41:7; 58:13; 73:20; and 98:5. These numbers add up to 2395. \nThis total does not quite make it as a multiple of 19; it is up by 1. \n\nThe Hajj Pilgrimage occurs in 2:189, 196, 197; 9:3; and 22:27. These numbers \nadd  up  to  645,  and  this  total  does  not  quite  make  it  as  a  multiple  of  19;  it  is   \ndown by 1. \n\nThus, Zakat and Hajj, together, give a total of 2395 + 645 = 3040 = 19x160. \n\nTHE  QURAN\u2019S \nMATHEMATICAL   STRUCTURE \n\nThe  Quran\u2019s  suras,  verses,  words,  and  letters  are  not  only  mathematically \ncomposed,  but  also  arranged  into  a  superhuman  structure  that  is  purely  mathe-\nmatical, i.e., the literary content has nothing to do with such an arrangement. \n\nSince the physical construction of the Quran is purely mathematical, it would \nbe  expected  that  the  numbers  mentioned  in  the  Quran  must  conform  with  the \nQuran\u2019s 19-based code. \n\nA  total  of  30  unique  numbers  are  mentioned  throughout  the  Quran,  and  the \nsum of all these numbers is 162146, a multiple of 19 (162146 = 19x8534). Table \n24 lists all the numbers mentioned in the Quran, without the repetitions. \n\n\f"

Only  a  \nfew  unauthorized  and  easily  detectable  printings \ndeviate  from  the  standard  system  that  is  divinely \nguarded. \n\nWhen  we  add  the  numbers  of  all  suras,  plus    \nthe  number  of  verses  in  every  sura,  plus  the  sum     \nof  verse  numbers,  the  Grand  total  for  the  whole \nQuran  comes  to  346199,  19x19x959.  Table  25  is  \nan  abbreviated  presentation  of  these  data.  Thus,     \nthe  slightest  alteration  of  a  single  sura  or  verse \nwould  have  destroyed  this  system.  As  shown  in \nTable  16,  if  we  consider  only  the  29  initialed \nsuras,  these  same  data  produce  a  Grand  Total  \nwhich  is  also  a  multiple  of  19.

            "1": "398 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSuperhuman Numerical \nCombinations \nLet us write down the number of each verse in the Quran, preceded for each \nsura by the number of verses in that sura. Thus, Sura 1, which consists of seven \nverses, will be represented by the number 7 1234567. What we are doing here is \nforming  long  numbers  by  writing  the  numbers  of  verses  next  to  each  other.  To \nfind  the  number  representing  Sura  2,  you  write  down  the  number  of  verses  in    \nthis sura, 286, followed by the number of every verse, written next to each other. \nThus,  the  number  representing  Sura  2  will  look  like  this:  286  12345\u2026..284285286. \nThe two numbers representing the first two suras are: \n\n7   1 2 3 4 5 6 7    &   286 1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286. \n\nPutting  these  two  numbers  together  to  form  one  number  representing  the    \n\nfirst two suras, we get this number: \n\n7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7   2 8 6   1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286. \n\nThis process is continued until every verse in the Quran is written down, thus \nforming  one  very  long  number  encompassing  the  number  of  every  verse  in  the \nQuran. The number representing the whole Quran is a multiple of 19 & consists \nof 12692 digits, which is also a multiple of 19. \n\n 7 1234567 286 12345\u2026286 \u20265 12345 6 123456 \n\nFIRST No: This very long number consists of 12692 digits (19x668) and \nand includes every verse in the Quran. The number of verses in each sura \nprecedes  its  verses.  A  special  computer  program  that  divides  very  long \nnumbers has shown that this long number is a multiple of 19. \n\nInstead of putting the total number of verses in every sura ahead of the sura, \nlet us put it at the end of every sura. Thus, the number representing Sura 1 will \nlook like this: 1234567 7, instead of 7 1234567. The number representing Sura 2 \nwill look like this: 12345.....284 285 286 286 instead of 286 12345 ......284285286. \nThe numbers representing the first two suras will look like this: \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  7   &   1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286 286. \nPutting these two numbers together to form a longer number representing the \n\nfirst two suras, we get a number that looks like this: \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  7    1 2 3 4 5.....284 285 286 286. \n\nSince  we  are  putting  the  total  number  of  verses  per  sura  at  the  end  of  each \nsura, we must put the total number of numbered verses (6234) at the end of the \nQuran. The last numbers, therefore, represent the last sura (123456 6), followed \nby the total number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234): \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6   6  &  6234   > > > 1 2 3 4 5 6 6  6234. \n\nPutting  together  all  the  verses  of  all  the  suras,  produces  a  long  number  that \n\nconsists of 12696 digits, and is a multiple of 19. \n\n \n \n \n \n\f"

The last 11 digits shown here are the 6 verses \nof the last sura, followed by its number of verses (6), followed by the \ntotal number of numbered verses in the Quran (6234). The complete, \nvery long number, is a multiple of 19. \n\nNow let us include the number of every sura. \n\nWrite down the number of every verse in every sura, followed by the number \nof  the  sura,  followed  by  the  number  of  verses  in  the  sura.

Similarly, you find that Israel were called \u201csons\u201d nineteen times, and \nthere are many other examples.

I will be a witness with you. \n\nWe  learn  from  Sura  33  that  Muhammad  was  one  of  the  prophets  who  made \n\nthat solemn covenant with God. \n\nAnd when we exacted a covenant from the Prophets, and from thee (O \nMuhammad) and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of \nMary, We took from them a solemn covenant.                                    (33:7) \n(according to Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall) \n\nVerse  3:81,  among  many  other  verses,  provides  the  definitions  of  \u201cNabi\u201d \n(Prophet) and \u201cRasoul\u201d (Messenger). Thus, \u201cNabi\u201d is a messenger of God who \ndelivers a new scripture, while \u201cRasoul\u201d is a messenger commissioned by God to \nconfirm  existing  scripture;  he  does  not  bring  a  new  scripture.  According  to  the \nQuran, every \u201cNabi\u201d is a \u201cRasoul\u201d but not every \u201cRasoul\u201d is a \u201cNabi\u201d \n\nNot every messenger was given a new scripture. It is not logical that God will \ngive a scripture to a prophet, then ask him to keep it exclusively for himself, as \nstated by some Muslim \u201cscholars\u201d (2:42, 146, 159). Those who are not sufficient-\nly  familiar  with  the  Quran  tend  to  think  that  Aaron  was  a  \u201cNabi\u201d  as  stated  in \n19:53, who did not receive a scripture. However, the Quran clearly states that the \nstatute book was given specifically \u201cto both Moses and Aaron\u201d (21:48, 37:117). \n\nWe  learn  from  the  Quran,  33:40,  that  Muhammad  was  the  last  prophet   \n\n(Nabi), but not the last messenger (Rasoul): \n\nMuhammad  was  not  the  father  of  any  of  your  men;  he  was  a  messenger \n(Rasoul) of God and the last prophet (Nabi). \n\n[ 33:40 ] \n\n\f"

The \nexpression  used  in  33:40,  \u201cMuhammad  Khaatum  Al-Nabiyyeen\u201d  (the  last   \nprophet)  has  a  gematrical  value  of  1349,  19x71,  while  the  value  of  the  erroneous \nexpression  \u201cMuhammad  Khaatum  Al-Mursaleen\u201d  (the  last  messenger)  is  not  a \nmultiple of 19. \n\nFrom  time  immemorial,  it  has  been  a  human  trait  to  reject  a  contemporary,      \n\nliving  messenger.  Joseph  was  declared  \u201cthe  last  messenger\u201d  (40:34).  Yet,  many \nmessengers  came  after  him,  including  Moses,  David,  Solomon,  Jesus,  and \nMuhammad. \n\nThe Covenant Fulfilled \n\nAlthough  the  prophets  are  dead,  as  far  as  this  world  is  concerned,  we  know      \nthat  their  souls,  the  real  persons,  are  now  in  the  Garden  of  Eden  where  Adam       \nand  Eve  lived.  Several  verses  enjoin  us  from  thinking  that  the  believers  who  shed     \ntheir  bodies  and  departed  this  world  are  dead  (2:154,  3:169,  4:69).  Although  they \ncannot  come  back  to  our  world  (23:100),  they  are  \u201calive\u201d  in  Paradise.  Please  see \nAppendix 17. \n\nDuring  my  Hajj  pilgrimage  to  Mecca,  and  before  sunrise  on  Tuesday,  Zul-    \nHijjah  3,  1391,  December  21,  1971,  I,  Rashad  Khalifa,  the  soul,  the  real  person,     \nnot  the  body,  was  taken  to  some  place  in  the  universe  where  I  was  introduced  to       \nall  the  prophets  as  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant.  I  was  not  informed  of  the  \ndetails and true significance of this event until Ramadan 1408. \n\nWhat  I  witnessed,  in  sharp  consciousness,  was  that  I  was  sitting  still,  while  the \nprophets,  one  by  one,  came  towards  me,  looked  at  my  face,  then  nodded  their    \nheads.  God  showed  them  to  me  as  they  had  looked  in  this  world,  attired  in  their \nrespective  mode  of  dress.  There  was  an  atmosphere  of  great  awe,  joy,  and  \nrespect. \n\nExcept  for  Abraham,  none  of  the  prophets  were  identified  to  me.  I  knew  that        \n\nall  the  prophets  were  there,  including  Moses,  Jesus,  Muhammad,  Aaron,  David,   \nNoah,  and  the  rest.  I  believe  that  the  reason  for  revealing  Abraham\u2019s  identity       \nwas  that  I  asked  about  him.  I  was  taken  aback  by  the  strong  resemblance  he  had        \nwith  my  own  family\u2014myself,  my  father,  my  uncles.  It  was  the  only  time  that  I \nwondered,  \u201cWho  is  this  prophet  who  looks  like  my  relatives?\u201d  The  answer  came: \n\u201cAbraham.\u201d No language was spoken. All communication was done mentally. \n\nIt  is  noteworthy  that  the  date  of  this  fulfillment  of  the  prophets\u2019  covenant  was     \n\nZul-Hijjah  3,  1391.  If  we  add  the  month  (12),  plus  the  day  (3),  plus  the  year \n(1391),  we  get  a  total  of  1406,  19x74.  Sura  74  is  where  the  Quran\u2019s  common \ndenominator, the number 19, is mentioned. Note that the number 1406 is also the \nnumber  of  years  from  the  revelation  of  the  Quran  to  the  revelation  of  its         \nmiracle (Appendix 1). \n\nThe  mission  of  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  is  to  confirm  existing  scrip-         \n\ntures,  purify  them,  and  consolidate  them  into  one  divine  message.  The  Quran     \nstates  that  such  a  messenger  is  charged  with  restoring  God\u2019s  message  to  its  pris-      \ntine  purity,  to  lead  the  righteous  believers\u2014Jews,  Christians,  Muslims,  Bud-    \ndhists,  Sikhs,  Hindus,  and  others\u2014out  of  darkness  into  the  light  (5:19  &  65:11).        \nHe  is  to  proclaim  that  Islam  (total  submission  to  God)  is  the only  religion accept-       \nable by God (3:19). \n\n\f"

Remarkably,  the  addi-\ntion  of  Ismail  and  Isaac  gave  a  total  that  is  still  a  multiple  of  19.  As  shown  in \nTable 5, the new total is 1235, or 19x65.

Unveil and proclaim the Quran\u2019s mathematical miracle (Appendix 1). \n2. Expose and remove the two false verses 9:128-129 from the Quran (App. 24). \n3. Explain the purpose of our lives; why we are here (Appendix 7). \n4. Proclaim one religion for all the people, and point out and purge away all  \nthe corruptions afflicting Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Appendices 13, \n15,19). \n5. Proclaim that Zakat (obligatory charity) is a prerequisite for redemption \n(7:156), and explain the correct method of observing Zakat (Appendix 15). \n6. Unveil the end of the world (Appendix 25). \n7. Proclaim that those who die before the age of 40 go to Heaven (Appendix  \n32). \n8. Explain Jesus\u2019 death (Appendix 22). \n9. Explain the Quran\u2019s delivery to, then through Muhammad (Appendix 28). \n10. Announce that Muhammad wrote God\u2019s revelations (the Quran) with his \nown hand (Appendix 28). \n11. Explain why most believers in God do not make it to Heaven (Appendix  \n27). \n12. Proclaim that God never ordered Abraham to kill his son (Appendix 9). \n13. Proclaim the secret of perfect happiness (Introduction, xx). \n14. Establish a criminal justice system (Appendix 37). \n\n \n \n\f"

            "1": "416 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nAppendix 3 \nWe Made the Quran Easy [54:17] \nVerse 11:1 informs us that the Quran\u2019s Miracle involves [1] the superhuman \nmathematical design of its physical structure and [2] the simultaneous composi-\ntion of a literary work of extraordinary excellence. \n\nOne may be able to meet the numerical distribution requirements of a simple \nmathematical pattern. However, this is invariably accomplished at the expense of \nthe  literary  quality.  The  simultaneous  control  of  the  literary  style  and  the  intri-      \ncate  mathematical  distribution  of  individual  letters  throughout  the  Quran  (Ap-\npendix 1) is evident in the fact that the Quran is made easy to memorize, under-\nstand,  and  enjoy.  Unlike  a  human-made  book,  the  Quran  is  enjoyable  to  read  \nover and over, infinitely. \n\nThe title of this Appendix is repeated in Sura 54, verses 17, 22, 32, and 40. As \nit turns out, the Quran\u2019s Arabic text is composed in such a way as to remind the \nreader  or  the  memorizer  of  the  next  correct  expression,  or  the  next  verse.  God \ncreated us and He knows the most efficient way for fixing literary materials into \nour memory. Memorization of the Quran has played a vital role in preserving the \noriginal  text  generation  after  generation  at  a  time  when  written  books  were  a \nrarity. \n\nWithout  even  realizing  it,  the  person  who  memorizes  the  Quran  is  divinely \nhelped  by  an  intricate  literary  system  as  he  utters  the  sounds  of  the  Quranic \nwords.  Almost  every  verse  in  the  Quran  contains  what  I  call  \u201cMemory  Bells.\u201d \nTheir function is to remind the reader of what comes next. This system is so vast, \nI will give only two illustrative examples: \n\n1. In Sura 2, Verses 127, 128, and 129 end with two different names of God \neach.  These  pairs  of  names  are  \u201cAl-Samee\u2018Al-\u2018Aleem  (The  Hearer,  the  Omnis-\ncient),\u201d  \u201cAl-Tawwaab  Al-Raheem  (The  Redeemer,  Most  Merciful)\u201d,  and  \u201cAl-\n\u2018Azeez  Al-Hakeem  (The  Almighty,  Most  Wise),\u201d  respectively.  If  this  were  a \nregular book, one would easily mis-match these six names. Not so in the Quran. \nEach  one  of  these  pairs  is  preceded  in  the  same  verse  by  a  \u201cMemory  Bell\u201d  that \nreminds  us  of  the  correct  pair  of  names.  Thus,  Verse  127  talks  about  Abraham  \nand  Ismail  raising  the  foundations  of  the  Ka\u2018abah.  The  verse  ends  with  the    \nnames \u201cAl-Samee\u2018 Al-\u2018Aleem.\u201d The prominent sounds here are the \u201cS,\u201d \u201cM,\u201d and   \n\u201c \u2018Ayn.\u201d These three letters are prominent in the word \u201cIsmail.\u201d We find that this \nword  is  conspicuously  delayed  in  the  sentence,  while  improving  its  literary \nquality.  Thus,  we  find  that  the  verse  goes  like  this:  \u201cWhen  Abraham  raised  the \nfoundations  of  the  Ka\u2018abah,  together  with  Ismail  ...\u201d  Normally,  a  human  writer \nwould say, \u201cWhen Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the Ka\u2018abah...\u201d \nBut  delaying  the  sounds  in  \u201cIsmail\u201d  brings  them  closer  to  the  end  of  the  verse,  \nand  thus  reminds  us  that  the correct names  of  God  in  this verse  are  \u201cAl-Samee\u2018  \nAl-\u2018Aleem.\u201d \n\nVerse 128 has the prominent word \u201cTubb\u201d just before the names \u201cAl-Tawwaab \nAl-Raheem.\u201d  The  word  \u201cTubb\u201d  thus  serves  as  the  memory  bell.  The  names  of   \nGod at the end of 2:129 are \u201cAzeez, Hakeem.\u201d The prominent sounds here are \n\n\f"

Another  good  example  is  found  in  3:176,  177,  &  178,  where  the  retribution      \n\nfor  disbelievers  is  described  as  \u201c  \u2018Azeem  (Terrible),\u201d  Aleem  (Painful),\u201d  and   \n\u201cMuheen  (Humiliating),\u201d  respectively.  In  a  human-made  book,  the  memorizer      \ncould  easily  mix  up  these  three  descriptions.  But  we  find  that  each  of  these  ad-  \njectives  is  preceded  by  powerful  memory  bells  that  prevent  such  a  mix-up.  The     \nword  \u201c  \u2018Azeem\u201d  of  Verse  176  is  preceded  by  the  word  \u201cHuzzun\u201d  which  is  charac-           \nterized  by  a  stressed  letter  \u201cZ.\u201d  This  serves  to  remind  us  of  the  particular  adjec-             \ntive  at  the  end  of  this  verse.  The  word  \u201cAleem\u201d  of  Verse  177  is  preceded  by  the \nsound  of  the  word  \u201cIman\u201d  to  serve  as  a  memory  bell,  and  the  word  \u201cMuheen\u201d  of                 \n3:178 is preceded by an abundance of \u201cM\u201d and \u201cH\u201d throughout this verse. \n\nOther  examples  of  memory  bells  include  the  ending  of  3:173  and  the  begin-     \nning  of  3:174,  the  ending  of  4:52  and  the  beginning  of  4:53,  the  ending  of  4:61    \nand  the  beginning  of  4:62,  the  ending  of  18:53  and  the  beginning  of  18:54,  and   \nmany more. \n                       ********************* \n\nAppendix 4 \nWhy Was the Quran Revealed in Arabic? \nWe  learn  from  41:44  that  the  sincere  believers  have  access  to  the  Quran, \nregardless  of  their  mother  tongue.  The  disbelievers,  on  the  other  hand,  are  not \npermitted  access  to  the  Quran,  even  if  they  are  professors  of  the  Arabic  lan-    \nguage (17:45, 18:57, 41:44, & 56:79). \n\nArabic  is  the  most  efficient  language  in  the  world,  especially  when  it  comes  to     \nthe  precise  statement  of  laws.  Since  the  Quran  is  a  Statute  Book,  it  was  crucial      \nthat  such  laws  must  be  clearly  stated.  God  chose  Arabic  for  His  Final  Testament \nbecause  of  the  obvious  reason  that  it  is  the  most  suitable  language  for  that  pur-              \npose.  Arabic  is  unique  in  its  efficiency  and  accuracy.  For  example,  the  word    \n\u201cthey\u201d  in  English  does  not  tell  you  if  \u201cthey\u201d  are  males  or  females.  In  Arabic        \nthere  is  a  \u201cthey\u201d  for  the  males,  \u201cHUM,\u201d  and  a  \u201cthey\u201d  for  the  females,  \u201cHUNNA.\u201d     \nThere  is  even  a  \u201cthey\u201d  for  two  males,  \u201cHUMAA,\u201d  and  a  \u201cthey\u201d  for  two  females, \n\u201cHAATAAN.\u201d  This  feature  does  not  exist  in  any  other  language  in  the  world.  I        \ncame  to  appreciate  this  efficiency  of  the  Arabic  language  when  I  translated,  for \nexample,  2:228.  This  verse  enjoins  the  divorcee  to  give  up  her  own  wishes  to \ndivorce  her  husband,  if  she  discovers  that  she  is  pregnant,  and  the  husband    \nwishes  to  reconcile\u2014the  welfare  of  the  child  takes  a  priority.  The  efficiency  of      \nthe  Arabic  language  was  extremely  helpful  in  stating  this  law.  Any  other  lan-    \nguage  would  have  made  it  almost  impossible  to  point  out  whose  wishes  are  to  be \nsuperseded, at least not in such a few words as we see in 2:228. \n\nThe  word  \u201cQaalataa\u201d  of  28:23,  for  example,  translates  into  four  English   \n\nwords: \u201cthe two women said.\u201d Such is the efficiency of the Arabic language. \n\nAnother  possible  reason  for  choosing  Arabic  is  the  fact  that  \u201cHe\u201d  and  \u201cShe\u201d         \ndo  not  necessarily  imply  natural  gender.  Thus,  when  God  is  referred  to  as  \u201cHe,\u201d       \nthis does not imply gender at all. God be glorified; He is neither male, nor \n\n\f"

The  usage  of  \u201cHe\u201d  to  refer  to  God  in  the  English  language,  for  example,     \nhas  contributed  to  a  false  image  of  God.  This  was  not  helped  by  such  distorted \nexpressions  as  \u201cFather\u201d  when  referring  to  God.  You  never  find  such  a  reference         \nto God in the Quran. \n\n************************* \n\nAppendix 5 \nHeaven and Hell \n\nThe  descriptions  of  Heaven  and  Hell  throughout  the  Quran  are  allegorical.       \n\nAnd  the  Quran  tells  us  so  whenever  such  descriptions  occur  as  independent \nstatements,  not  within  a  general  subject.  See  2:24-26,  13:35,  and  47:15.  The  word \n\u201cMathal\u201d  (allegory)  is  used  in  these  verses.  Linguistically,  the  word  \u201cMathal\u201d  in    \nthese  verses  can  be  removed,  and  we  still  have  perfect  sentences.  But  it  is  there \nbecause the descriptions of Heaven and Hell are allegorical. \n\nWhat  Heaven  and  Hell  are  really  like  is  far  beyond  our  comprehension.   \n\nHence the need for allegory. \n\nHow  can  one  describe,  for  example,  the  taste  of  chocolate  to  a  person  who   \nnever  tasted  chocolate?  Allegory  will  have  to  be  used.  The  person  has  to  wait  to \nactually  taste  chocolate  in  order  to  know  what  chocolate  tastes  like.  Whatever   \nallegory  we  use  to  describe  the  taste  of  chocolate  can  never  approximate  the  real  \nthing. \n\nHeaven  already  exists,  since  Adam  and  Eve  were  placed  in  it  during  their     \n\ndays  of  innocence  (2:35).  We  learn  from  Sura  55  that  there  are  two  \u201cHigh \nHeavens\u201d\u2014one  for  the  humans  and  one  for  the  jinns\u2014and  two  \u201cLower \nHeavens\u201d\u2014one  for  the  humans  and  one  for  the  jinns  (see  Appendix  11  for  more \ndetails). \n\nHell  is  not  created  yet.  It  will  be  created  on  the  Day  of  Judgment  (69:17  & \n\n89:23). More details are given in Appendix 11. \n\nThe High Heaven vs. The Lower Heaven \n\nThere  are  profound  differences  between  the  High  Heaven  and  the  Lower   \nHeaven.  Allegorically,  water  in  the  High  Heaven  flows  freely  (55:50),  while  the \nwater of the Lower Heaven needs to be pumped out (55:66). \n\nAllegorically,  the  High  Heaven  has  all  kinds  of  fruit  (55:52),  while  the  Lower \n\nHeaven has a limited variety of fruits (55:68). \n\nAllegorically,  the  pure  spouses  readily  join  their  spouses  in  the  High  Heaven \n(55:56),  while  the  dwellers  of  the  Lower  Heaven  must  go  fetch  their  spouses \n(55:72). \n\nYet,  even  the  Lower  Heaven  is  an  incredibly  fantastic  prize  for  those  who  are \nfortunate  enough  to  escape  Hell  and  end  up  in  the  Lower  Heaven  (3:185)\u2014     \ngoing  to  the  Lower  Heaven  is  a  great  triumph.  People  who  depart  this  life  before \nreaching their 40th birthday, and did not sufficiently develop their souls, will go to \nthe Lower Heaven (46:15, Appendices 11 & 32).

Meanwhile,  our  scientific  advances  have  shown  us  that  our  galaxy, \nthe  Milky  Way,  is  100,000  light  years  across,  and  that  our  universe  contains  a \nbillion  such  galaxies  and  a  billion  trillion  stars,  plus  countless  decillions  of \nheavenly  bodies.  Our  universe  is  estimated  to  span  distances  in  excess  of \n20,000,000,000 light years. \n\nCount the Stars! \nIf we take only a quintillion [1,000,000,000,000,000,000] of the stars and simply \ncount them [from 0 to quintillion] one count per second, day and night, this will \ntake 32 billion years (more than the age of the universe). That is how long it will \ntake  to  just  \u201ccount\u201d  them;  but  God  \u201ccreated\u201d  them.  Such  is  the  greatness  of     \nGod. \n\nWe can appreciate the vastness of \nour universe if we imagine going on a \nspace  odyssey.  When  we  leave  the \nplanet  Earth  towards  the  sun,  at  the \nspeed of light, we reach the sun after \n93,000,000 miles and 8 minutes. It will \ntake us more than 50,000 years at the \nspeed of light to exit our galaxy. From \nthe outer limit of the Milky Way, our \nplanet Earth is invisible. Not even the  \nmost powerful telescope can detect our tiny \u201cEarth.\u201d \n\nWe have to spend more than 2,000,000 years at the speed of light to reach our \nnext-door  galaxy.  At  least  10,000,000,000  years,  at  the  speed  of  light,  must  be \nspent  to  reach  the  outer  limit  of  our  universe.  From  the  outer  limit  of  our  \nuniverse, even the Milky Way is like a speck of dust in a large room. \n\nThe second universe surrounds our universe. The third universe is larger than \nthe  second,  and  so  on.  More  accurately,  our  universe  should  be  considered  the \nseventh  universe,  surrounded  by  the  sixth  universe,  which  is  surrounded  by  the \nfifth universe, and so on.

One  of  the  high-ranking  creatures,  Satan,  entertained  super-               \ncilious  thoughts  that  his  God-given  powers  qualified  him  to  be  a  god  besides    \nGod.  He  thus  challenged  God\u2019s  absolute  authority.  Not  only  was  Satan\u2019s  idea \nblasphemous,  it  was  wrong\u2014only  God,  and  no  one  else,  possesses  the  qualifica-         \ntions  and  ability  to  be  a  god.  Consequent  to  Satan\u2019s  blasphemy,  a  division  oc-             \ncurred  in  the  Heavenly  Society,  and  all  constituents  of  God\u2019s  kingdom  became \nclassified into four categories: \n1. Angels: Creatures who upheld God\u2019s absolute authority. \n2. Animals: Creatures who rebelled but then accepted God\u2019s invitation to repent. \n3. Jinns: Creatures who agreed with Satan; that he is capable of being a \u201cgod.\u201d \n4. Humans:  Creatures  who  did  not  make  up  their  minds;  they  failed  to  make  a       \nfirm stand with God\u2019s absolute authority. \n\nThe Most Merciful \n\nThe  angels  expected  God  to  banish  the  creatures  who  did  not  uphold  His  \nabsolute  authority  (2:30).  But  God  is  Most  Merciful;  He  decided  to  give  us  a  \nchance  to  denounce  our  mistake,  and  informed  the  angels  that  He  knew  what      \nthey  did  not  know  (2:30).  God  knew  that  some  creatures  deserved  a  chance  to      \nbe redeemed. \n\nIf  you claim  the ability  to fly a  plane, the best  way  to test  your  claim is to give    \n\nyou  a  plane  and  ask  you  to  fly  it.  This  is  precisely  what  God  decided  to  do  in \nresponse  to  Satan\u2019s  claim.  God  created  seven  vast  universes,  then  informed  the    \nangels  that  He  was  appointing  Satan  as  a  god  on  the  tiny  mote  called  \u201cEarth\u201d     \n(2:30).  The  Quranic  accounts  related  to  appointing  Satan  as  a  temporary  \u201cgod\u201d \n(36:60) confirm the previous scripture. \n\nGod\u2019s  plan  called  for  creating  death  (67:1-2),  then  bringing  the  humans  and      \n\njinns into this world.

Thus,  upholding  God\u2019s \nabsolute  authority  is  a  natural  in-\nstinct that is an integral part of every \nhuman being. \n\nThe devil  then took  Jesus  up  a very  high \nmountain  and  displayed  before  him  all   \nthe  kingdoms  of  the  world  in  their  mag-\nnificence, promising: \u201cAll these will I be-\nstow  on  you  if  you  prostrate  yourself  in \nhomage before me.\u201d At this, Jesus said to \nhim, \u201cAway with you, Satan!  \nScripture has it: \n\u2018You shall worship the Lord your God; \nHim ALONE shall you adore.\u2019 \u201d \n\nAfter putting the rebels to death, \nthe souls of humans and jinns were \nplaced in a special depository. God \nthen  created  the  appropriate  bodies \nto  house  the  souls  of  jinns  and \nhumans  during  the  test  period.  The \nfirst jinn body was made from fire, \nand Satan was assigned to that body (15:27). The first human body was created \nfrom earthly material, clay (15:26), and God assigned the first human soul to that \nbody. The divine plan called for the angels to serve the humans on earth\u2014guard \nthem,  drive  the  wind  and  rain  for  them,  distribute  provisions,  etc.  This  fact  is \nstated  in  the  Quran  allegorically:  \u201cYour  Lord  said  to  the  angels,  \u2018Fall  prostrate \nbefore Adam.\u2019 \u201d Satan of course refused to have anything to do with serving the \nhuman race (2:34, 7:11, 17:61, 18:50, 20:116). \n\n[Matthew 4:8-10] & [Luke 4:5-8] \n\nWhile  Adam\u2019s  body  remained  on  earth,  the  real  person,  the  soul,  was  ad- \nmitted  into  Heaven  in  the  outermost  universe.  God  gave  Adam  certain  com-\nmandments,  represented  by  the  forbidden  tree,  and  Satan  was  appointed  as \nAdam\u2019s companion to deliver to Adam his satanic message. The rest is history. \n\nEvery  time  a  human  being  is  born,  a  human  person  is  assigned  to  the  new \nbaby from the depository of souls. God assigns the souls in accordance with His \nknowledge (28:68). Every soul deserves to be assigned to a certain body, and live \nunder  certain  circumstances.  God  alone  knows  which  souls  are  good  and  which \nsouls are evil. Our children are assigned to our homes in accordance with God\u2019s \nplan. \n\nAn  independent  jinn  soul  is  also  assigned  to  the  new  human  being  to  repre-     \n\nsent  Satan\u2019s  point  of  view.  While  the  physical  body  of  any  jinn  is  reproduced \nfrom the parent jinns, the jinn soul is that of an independent individual. Jinns are \ndescendants  of  Satan  (7:27,  18:50).  The  assigned  jinn  remains  with  the  human \nbeing from birth to death, and serves as the main witness on the Day of Judg- \n\n\f"

A  continuous  debate  takes  place  in  our  heads  between  the  human    \nsoul and the jinn soul until both of them are convinced of one point of view. \n\nThe Original Sin \n\nContrary  to  common  belief,  the  \u201cOriginal  Sin\u201d  was  not  Adam\u2019s  violation  of      \nGod\u2019s  law  when  he  ate  from  the  forbidden  tree.  The  original  sin  was  our  failure         \nto  uphold  God\u2019s  absolute  authority  during  the  Great  Feud.  If  the  human  person \nconvinces  his  or  her  jinn  companion  to  denounce  that  original  sin,  and  uphold      \nGod\u2019s  absolute  authority,  both  creatures  are  redeemed  to  God\u2019s  eternal  kingdom         \non  the  Day  of  Judgment.  But  if  the  jinn  companion  convinces  the  human  being       \nto  uphold  Satan\u2019s  idolatrous  views,  then  both  creatures  are  exiled  forever  from     \nGod\u2019s kingdom. \n\nTo  promote  his  point  of  view,  Satan  and  his  representatives  advocate  the \nidolization  of  such  powerless  creatures  as  Muhammad,  Jesus,  Mary,  and  the     \nsaints.  Since  we  are  here  due  to  our  polytheistic  tendencies,  most  of  us  are  easy    \nprey for Satan. \n\nSatan\u2019s  incompetence  as  a  \u201cgod\u201d  has  already  been  proven  by  the  prevalence        \nof  chaos,  disease,  accidents,  misery,  and  war  throughout  his  dominion  (36:66).           \nOn  the  other  hand,  the  human  beings  who  denounce  Satan,  uphold  God\u2019s  ab-      \nsolute  authority,  and  refrain  from  idolizing  powerless  and  dead  creatures  like       \nJesus  and  Muhammad,  are  restored  to  God\u2019s  protection\u2014they  enjoy  a  perfect       \nlife here in this world and forever. \n\nBecause  our  life  in  this  world  is  a  series  of  tests  designed  to  expose  our \npolytheistic  ideas,  idol  worship  is  the  only  unforgivable  offense  (4:48,  116).  The \nworld  is  divinely  designed  to  manifest  our  decision  to  uphold  either  God\u2019s  ab-            \nsolute  authority,  or  Satan\u2019s  idolatrous  views  (67:1-2).  The  day  and  the  night     \nchange  constantly  to  test  our  willingness  to  uphold  God\u2019s  laws  by  observing  the    \nDawn  Prayer  and  fasting  during  the  hottest  and  longest  days.  Only  those  who  are    \ntotally certain about God\u2019s absolute authority are redeemed (26:89). \n\n********************* \nAppendix 8 \nThe Myth of Intercession \n\nTo  believe  that  anyone,  other  than  God,  can  intercede  on  our  behalf  to  have      \n\nour  sins  forgiven  or  our  wishes  fulfilled,  is  to  set  up  partners  with  God.  This  is \nidolatry.  The  Quran  proclaims  that  \u201cAll  intercession  belongs  to  God\u201d  (39:44),       \nand that there will be \u201cno intercession on the Day of Judgment\u201d (2:254). \n\nThe  myth  of  intercession  is  one  of  Satan\u2019s  most  effective  tricks  to  dupe  mil-     \n\nlions  of  people  into  idol  worship.  Millions  of  Christians  believe  that  Jesus  will \nintercede  for  them  at  God,  and  millions  of  Muslims  believe  that  Muhammad  will \nintercede  on  their  behalf.  Consequently,  these  people  idolize  Jesus  and  Muham-    \nmad. \n\nThe  concept  of  intercession  is  utterly  illogical.  Those  who  believe  in \nMuhammad\u2019s intercession, for example, claim that he will ask God to forgive \n\n\f"

If  you  ask  those  who  \nbelieve  in  intercession:  \u201cHow  will  Muhammad  recognize  those  who  deserve  his \nintercession?\u201d  they  tell  you,  \u201cGod  will  tell  him!\u201d  According  to  this  concept,  a    \nperson  will  go  to  Muhammad  and  request  his  intercession.  Muhammad  will  then      \nask  God  whether  this  person  deserves  his  intercession  or  not.  God  will  inform \nMuhammad  that  the  person  deserves  to  go  to  Paradise.  Muhammad  will  then        \nturn  around  and  tell  God  that  the  person  deserves  to  go  to  Paradise!  The  blas-              \nphemy is obvious; those who believe in intercession make God a secretary of their \nidol Muhammad. God be glorified. \n\nSince  the  Quran  is  the  most  accurate  book,  it  acknowledges  that  everyone  in \nParadise  will  intercede  on  behalf  of  his  or  her  loved  ones:  \u201cPlease  God,  admit      \nmy  mother  into  Paradise.\u201d  This  intercession  will  work  if  the  person\u2019s  mother    \ndeserves  to  go  to  Paradise  (2:255,  20:109,  21:28).  Thus,  intercession,  though  it    \nwill take place in this manner, is utterly useless. \n\nWe  learn  from  the  Quran  that  Abraham,  God\u2019s  beloved  servant,  could  not   \nintercede  on  behalf  of  his  father  (9:114).  Noah  could  not  intercede  on  behalf  of      \nhis  son  (11:46).  Muhammad  could  not  intercede  on  behalf  of  his  uncle  (111:1-3)      \nor  relatives  (9:80).  What  makes  anyone  think  that  a  prophet  or  a  saint  will  inter-              \ncede  on  behalf  of  a  perfect  stranger?!  See  2:48,  123;  6:51,  70,  94;  7:53;  10:3;   \n19:87;  26:100;  30:13;  32:4;  36:23;  39:44;  40:18;  43:86;  53:26  &  74:48.  Muhammad\u2019s \nintercession is in 25:30. \n\n   ********************* \nAppendix 9  \nAbraham:   Original Messenger of Islam \nOne  of  the  prevalent  myths  is  that  Muhammad  was  the  founder  of  Islam.  \nAlthough  Islam,  total  submission  to  God  alone,  is  the  only  religion  recognized  by   \nGod  since  the  time  of  Adam  (3:19,  85),  Abraham  is  reported  in  the  Quran  as  the     \nfirst  user  of  the  word  \u201cIslam\u201d  (Submission)  and  the  one  who  called  us  \u201cMus-     \nlims\u201d,  i.e.,  Submitters  (22:78).  Abraham\u2019s  exemplary  submission  to  God  is \ndemonstrated  by  his  famous  willingness  to  sacrifice  his  only  son,  Ismail,  when  he \nthought  that  that  was  God\u2019s  command.  As  it  turns  out,  such  a  command  was  in       \nfact from Satan. \n\nGod Never Ordered Abraham to Sacrifice His Son \n\nGod  is  the  Most  Merciful.  He  never  violates  His  own  law  (7:28).  Any  person   \nwho  believes  that  the  Most  Merciful  ordered  Abraham  to  kill  his  son  cannot   \npossibly  make  it  to  God\u2019s  Heaven.  Such  evil  thought  about  God  is  grossly  blas-\nphemous.  Nowhere  in  the  Quran  do  we  see  that  God  ordered  Abraham  to  kill       \nhis  son.  On  the  contrary,  God  intervened  to  save  Abraham  and  Ismail  from     \nSatan\u2019s  plot  (37:107),  and  He  told  Abraham:  \u201cYou  believed  the  dream\u201d  (37:105). \nUndoubtedly,  it  was  a  dream  inspired  by  Satan.  God\u2019s  irrevocable  law  is:  \u201cGod    \nnever advocates sin\u201d (7:28). \n\nMillat Ibrahim \nIslam is called \u201cMillat Ibrahim\u201d (The Religion of Abraham) throughout the \n\n\f"

Moreover,    \nthe Quran informs us that Muhammad was a follower of Abraham (16:123). \n\nDue  to  a  general  unawareness  of  the  fact  that  Abraham  was  the  original \nmessenger  of  Islam,  many  so-called  Muslims  challenge  God:  \u201cIf  the  Quran  is \ncomplete  and  fully  detailed  (as  claimed  by  God),  where  can  we  find  the  number       \nof  Rak\u2018ahs  (units)  in  each  contact  prayer  (Salat)?\u201d  We  learn  from  the  Quran  that        \nall  religious  practices  of  Islam  (Submission)  were  already  established  before  the \nQuran\u2019s  revelation  (8:35,  9:54,  16:123,  21:73,  22:27,  28:27).  Verse  16:123  is  direct \nproof  that  all  religious  practices  in  Islam  were  intact  when  Muhammad  was     \nborn.  Muhammad  was  enjoined  to  \u201cfollow  the  religion  of  Abraham.\u201d  If  I  ask  you        \nto  buy  a  color  TV,  it  is  assumed  that  you  know  what  a  color  TV  is.  Similarly,       \nwhen  God  enjoined  Muhammad  to  follow  the  practices  of  Abraham  (16:123),     \nsuch practices must have been well known. \n\nAnother  proof  of  divine  preservation  of  the  Islamic  practices  given  to   \nAbraham  is  the  \u201cUniversal  Acceptance\u201d  of  such  practices.  There  is  no  dispute \nconcerning  the  number  of  Rak\u2018ahs  in  all  five  daily  prayers.  This  proves  the  divine \npreservation  of  Salat.  The  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  code  confirms  the  number  of    \nRak\u2018ahs  in  the  five  prayers  2,  4,  4,  3,  and  4,  respectively.  The  number  24434  is  a \nmultiple of 19. \n\nThe  Quran  deals  only  with  practices  that  were  distorted.  For  example,  the   \ndistorted  ablution  is  restored  in  5:6  to  its  original  four  steps.  The  tone  of  voice    \nduring  the  contact  prayers  (Salat)  was  distorted\u2014many  Muslims  pray  silently.      \nThis  was  corrected  in  the  Quran,  17:110.  The  fasting  during  Ramadan  was  \nmodified  in  the  Quran  to  allow  intercourse  during  the  night  (2:187).  Zakat  is   \nrestored  in  6:141,  and  Hajj  is  restored  to  the  four  correct  months  (see  Appendix     \n15). \n\n******************** \n  Appendix   10 \nGod\u2019s Usage of the Plural Tense \n\nIn  the  English  speaking  world,  where  the  trinity  doctrine  is  prevalent,  some     \n\npeople  are  intrigued  by  God\u2019s  usage  of  the  plural  tense  in  the  Quran.  The  over-\nwhelming  message  of  the  Quran,  where  there  is  absolutely  no  compromise  is  that \n\u201cGOD  IS  ONE\u201d  (2:133,  163;  4:171;  5:73;  6:19;  9:31;  12:39;  13:16;  14:48,  52;   \n16:22, 51; 18:110; 21:108; 22:34; 37:4; 38:65; 39:4; 40:16; 41:6; 112:1). \n\nWhenever  the  first  person  plural  form  is  used  by  the  Almighty,  it  invariably \nindicates  participation  of  other  entities,  such  as  the  angels.  For  example,  the \nrevelation  of  this  Quran  involved  participation  of  the  angel  Gabriel  and  the    \nprophet  Muhammad.  Hence  the  use  of  the  plural  form  in  15:9:  \u201cWe  revealed  this \nscripture,  and  we  will  preserve  it.\u201d  The  plural  form  here  simply  reflects  the  fact        \nthat  the  angel  Gabriel  and  the  prophet  Muhammad  participated  in  the  process          \nof delivering the Quran. \n\nAnother  example  has  to  do  with  blowing  the  breath  of  life  into  Adam  and    \nJesus.  The  creation  of  Adam  took  place  in  heaven  and  God  directly  blew  into     \nhim the breath of life. Thus, the first person singular form is consistently used: \u201cI \n\n\f"

The      \nplural  form  is  consistently  used  when  referring  to  the  creation  of  Jesus  (21:91,   \n66:12). \n\nWhen  God  spoke  to  Moses  directly,  without  the  mediation  of  angels,  we  see    \nthat  God  is  speaking  exclusively  in  the  singular  tense:  \u201cI  am  God.  There  is  no            \nother  god  besides  Me.

Similarly,  we  live  here  on  earth,  and  when       \nwe  exit  the  grave  on  the  Day  of  Resurrection  we  will  not  be  earthbound;  like  the \nbutterfly (101:4). \n\nThe  earth  will  shine  with  the  light  of  God  (39:69)  as  He  comes  to  our  \nuniverse,  together  with  the  angels  (89:22).  Since  our  universe  is  a  temporary \ndominion  for  Satan,  it  cannot  stand  the  physical  presence  of  God  (7:143).  As  the \nAlmighty  approaches,  the  stars  will  crash  into  one  another  (77:8,  81:2),  and  the      \nearth  will  shatter  under  our  feet  (69:14,  89:21).

God  does  not  put  a  single  being  in  Hell;  they  go  to  it  of  their  own \nvolition (Appendix 5). \n\n******************** \nAppendix 12 \nRole of the Prophet Muhammad \nThe Prophet\u2019s sole mission was to deliver Quran, the whole Quran, and noth-\ning but Quran (3:20; 5:48-50, 92, 99; 6:19; 13:40; 16:35, 82; 24:54; 29:18; 42:48; \n64:12). \n\nDelivering  the  Quran  was  such  a  momentous  and  noble  mission  that  the \nProphet  did  not  have  any  time  to  do  anything  else.  Moreover,  the  Prophet  was \nenjoined in the strongest words from issuing any religious teachings besides the \nQuran (69:38-47). He was even enjoined from explaining the Quran (75:15-19)\u2014 \nGod is the only teacher  of  the  Quran  (55:1-2) and the  Quran  is the  best  Hadith \n(39:23 & 45:6). \n\nThese  Quranic  facts  are  manifested  in  the  historical  reality  that  the  words    \n\nand  actions  (Hadith  &  Sunna)  attributed  to  the  Prophet  did  not  appear  until  the \nsecond  century  after  his  death.  The  Quran  has  prophesied  the  fabrication  of \nHadith  and  Sunna  by  the  Prophet\u2019s  enemies  (6:112-115).  The  Quran  teaches  us \nthat  it  was  God\u2019s  will  to  permit  the  invention  of  Hadith  and  Sunna  to  serve  as \ncriteria  for  exposing  those  who  believe  only  with  their  lips,  not  in  their  hearts. \nThose  who  are  attracted  to  Hadith  and  Sunna  are  proven  to  be  false  believers \n(6:113).  Ironically,  the  books  of  Hadith  report  the  Prophet\u2019s  orders  to  write    \ndown  nothing  from  him  except  the  Quran!  Shown  below  are  two  such  Hadiths \ntaken  from  the  Hadithists\u2019  most  reliable  sources,  Sahih  Muslim  and  Is-haah \nAhmad Ibn Hanbal: \n\nThe Prophet said, \u201cDo not write down anything from me except the Quran.\u201d \n\n[Ahmed, Vol. 1, Page 171, and Sahih Muslim] \n\n \n \n\f"

Millions  of  Muslims  have  adopted \nSatan\u2019s  polytheistic  version,  and  insist  upon  mentioning  the  name  of  Muhammad \nbesides  the  name  of  God.  However,  the  Quran\u2019s  great  criterion  in  39:45  stamps \nsuch  Muslims  as  disbelievers:  \u201cWhen  God  ALONE  is  mentioned,  the  hearts  of \nthose who do disbelieve in the Hereafter shrink with aversion, but when others  are \nmentioned with Him, they become satisfied.\u201d \n\nI  have  conducted  extensive  research  into  this  criterion,  and  I  have  reached  a \nstartling  conclusion:  the  idol  worshipers  who  do  not  uphold  the  First  Pillar  of   \nIslam  as  dictated  in  3:18  are  forbidden  by  God  from  uttering  the  correct    \nShahadah.  They  simply  cannot  say:  \u201cAsh-hadu  Allaa  Elaaha  Ellaa  Allah\u201d  by  it- \nself,  without  mentioning  the  name  of  Muhammad.  Try  it  with  any  idol  worshiper \nwho  claims  to  be  a  Muslim.  Challenge  them  to  say:  \u201cAsh-hadu  Allaa  Elaaha    \nEllaa Allah.\u201d They can never say it. Since this is the religion of Abraham (2:130, \n135;  3:95;  4:125;  6:161;  12:37-38;  16:123;  22:78;  Appendix  9),  the  ONLY  creed \nmust  be  \u201cLAA  ELAAHA  ELLAA  ALLAH  (there  is  no  god  except  the  One        \nGod)\u201d. Muhammad did not exist on earth before Abraham. \n\nA Gross Blasphemy \n\nThere  is  no  greater  blasphemy  than  distorting  the  Quran  to  idolize  the       \n\nprophet  Muhammad  against  his  will.  Verse  19  of  Sura  \u201cMuhammad\u201d  (47:19)  \nstates:  \u201cYou  shall  know  that  there  is  no  god  except  the  one  God.\u201d  Shown  below      \nis  a  photocopy  of  the  regular  logo  of  a  Muslim  publication  THE  REVIEW  OF \nRELIGIONS  (The  London  Mosque,  16  Gressenhall  Road,  London  SW18  5QL, \nEngland).

It  is  God\u2019s  will  that  we    \n\nwill freely (18:29, 25:57, 73:19, 74:37, 76:29, 78:39, 80:12). \n\nAfter  committing  our  original  sin  (Appendix  7),  God  gave  us  a  chance  to \ndenounce  our  crime  and  accept  His  absolute  authority  (33:72).  But  we  decided      \nthat  we  wanted  to  see  a  demonstration  of  Satan\u2019s  competence  as  a  god.  Many    \npeople  protest  the  fact  that  God  has  created  them,  to  put  them  through  this   \ngruesome  test.  Obviously,  such  people  are  not  aware  that  [1]  they  have  com-            \nmitted  a  horrendous  crime  (Introduction  &  Appendix  7),  and  [2]  that  they  were      \ngiven  a  chance  to  denounce  their  crime  and  redeem  themslves,  but  they  chose  to      \ngo through the test. \n\nWe  learn  from  57:22  that  our  lives,  along  with  everything  else  around  us,  are        \n\npre-recorded  on  something  like  a  videotape.  God  fully  knows  what  kind  of \ndecision  each  of  us  is  destined  to  make;  He  knows  which  of  us  are  going  to \nHeaven  and  which  are  going  to  Hell.  Even  before  we  were  born  into  this  world,    \nGod  knew  which  souls  are  good  and  which  souls  are  evil.  As  far  as  God\u2019s  omnis-\ncience  is  concerned,  we  can  imagine  a  stamp  on  everyone\u2019s  forehead  that  says \n\u201cHeaven\u201d  or  \u201cHell.\u201d  Yet,  as  far  as  we  are  concerned,  we  are  totally  free  to  side     \nwith  God\u2019s  absolute  authority,  or  Satan\u2019s  polytheistic  views.  Predestination, \ntherefore, is a fact as far as God is concerned, not as far as we are concerned. \n\nThis  understanding  explains  the  numerous  verses  stating  that  \u201cGod  guides \nwhomever  He  wills,  and  misleads  whomever  He  wills.\u201d  Based  on  His  knowledge,  \nGod  assigns  our  souls  to  the  circumstances  that  we  deserve.  When  God  said  to       \nthe  angels,  \u201cI  know  what  you  do  not  know\u201d  (2:30),  this  meant  that  some  of  us \ndeserved  a  chance  to  redeem  ourselves.  One  example  of  God\u2019s  guidance  for    \nthose  who  deserve  guidance  is  found  in  21:51:  \u201cWe  granted  Abraham  his \nguidance,  for  we  were  fully  aware  of  him.\u201d  In  other  words,  God  knew  that  \nAbraham  was  a  good  soul  who  deserved  to  be  guided,  and  God  granted  him  his \nguidance  and  understanding.  Another  good  example  is  stated  in  12:24.  Joseph      \nfell for the Egyptian nobleman\u2019s wife, and almost committed adultery \u201cif it were \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

Or,  was  it  God\u2019s  protection  from  sin  that   \nrendered him chaste? Such is predestination. \n\n***************************** \nAppendix 15 \nReligious Duties: A Gift From God \n\nWhen  Abraham  implored  God  in  14:40,  he  did  not  ask  for  wealth  or  health;        \nthe  gift  he  implored  for  was:  \u201cPlease  God,  make  me  one  who  observes  the  con-          \ntact  prayers  (Salat).\u201d  The  religious  duties  instituted  by  God  are  in  fact  a  great       \ngift  from  Him.  They  constitute  the  nourishment  required  for  the  growth  and \ndevelopment  of  our  souls.  Without  such  nourishment,  we  cannot  survive  the  im-   \nmense  energy  associated  with  God\u2019s  physical  presence  on  the  Day  of  Judgment.  \nBelief  in  God  does  not  by  itself  guarantee  our  redemption;  we  must  also  nourish      \nour  souls  (6:158,  10:90-92).  Additionally,  15:99  states  that  observing  the  religious \nduties  instituted  by  God  is  our  means  of  attaining  certainty:  \u201cWorship  your  Lord          \nin order to attain certainty.\u201d \n\nThe Contact Prayers (Salat) \n\nThe  five  daily  contact  prayers  are  the  main  meals  for  the  soul.  While  a  soul    \nmay  attain  some  growth  and  development  by  leading  a  righteous  life,  and    \nwithout  observing  the  contact  prayers,  this  would  be  like  surviving  on  snacks   \nwithout regular meals. \n\nWe  learn  from  2:37  that  we  can  establish  contact  with  God  by  uttering  the    \n\nspecific  Arabic  words  given  to  us  by  God.  Sura  1,  The  Key,  is  a  mathematically \ncomposed combination of sounds that unlocks the door between us and God: \n\n1. The  Dawn  Prayer  must  be  observed  during  two  hours  before  sunrise  \n(11:114, 24:58). \n2. The  Noon  Prayer  is  due  when  the  sun  declines  from  its  highest  point  at    \nnoon (17:78). \n3. The  Afternoon  Prayer  can  be  observed  during  the  3-4  hours  preceding    \nsunset (2:238). \n4. The Sunset Prayer becomes due after sunset (11:114). \n5. The  Night  Prayer  can  be  observed  after  the  twilight  disappears  from  the      \nsky (24:58). \n*  The  Friday  noon  congregational  prayer  is  an  obligatory  duty  upon  every \nSubmitting  man  and  woman  (62:9).  Failure  to  observe  the  Friday  Prayer  is  a      \ngross offense. \n\nEach  contact  prayer  is  valid  if  observed  anytime  during  the  period  it  becomes       \ndue  until  the  next  prayer  becomes  due.  Once  missed,  a  given  contact  prayer  is  a     \nmissed  opportunity  that  cannot  be  made  up;  one  can  only  repent  and  ask  for-                 \ngiveness. The five prayers consist of 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4 units (Rak\u2019ahs), respectively. \n\nThe proof that Salat was already established through Abraham is found in \n\n\f"

This most important duty in Islam (Submission) has \nbeen  so  severely  distorted  that  the  contact  prayers  (Salat)  have  become  a  prac-     \ntice in idolatry for the vast majority of Muslims. Although the Quran commands \nthat our contact prayers must be devoted to God alone (20:14; 39:3, 45), today\u2019s \nMuslims  insist on commemorating \u201cMuhammad and his  family\u201d and \u201cAbraham \nand  his  family\u201d  during  their  prayers.  This  renders  the  prayers  null  and  void \n(39:65). \n\nThe following text, pertaining to the miracles confirming the contact prayers, is ex-\ncerpted from the January 1990 issues of the Submitter\u2019s Perspective (the regular and \nspecial bonus issues), as written by Dr. Rashad Khalifa: \n\nAWESOME MATHEMATICAL MIRACLE \nCONFIRMS ALL THE 5 CONTACT PRAYERS \n[1] Sura 1 is God\u2019s gift to us, to establish contact with Him (Salat).

This is what we get: \n\n1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  \nnumber is a multiple of 19. \n\nThis \n\n[3]  Now,  let  us  replace \neach  verse  number  by  the \nnumber  of \nthat  \nverse. This is what we get: \n\nletters \n\nin \n\nVerse No  No of Letters  \n    1  \n    2  \n    3  \n    4  \n    5  \n    6  \n    7  \n\n19 \n17 \n12 \n11 \n19 \n18 \n43 \n\nGematrical Value \n\n 786 \n 581 \n 618 \n 241 \n 836 \n      1072 \n      6009 \n\n1  19  17  12  11  19  18  43  also  a  multiple  of  19.  Theoretically,  one  can  alter      \n\nthe  letters  of  Sura  1,  and  still  keep  the  same  number  of  letters,  However,  the \nfollowing  mathematical  phenomena  rule  out  that  possibility.  For  the  gematrical \nvalue of every single letter is taken into consideration. Here it is: \n\n[4] Let us include the gematrical value of every verse, and write it down fol-\n\nlowing the number of letters in each verse: \n\n1  19  786  17  581  12  618  11  241  19  836  18  1072  43  6009  also  a  multiple          \n\nof 19. \n\n[5] Now, let us add the number of each verse, to be followed by the number   \nof  letters  in  that  verse,  then  the  gematrical  value  of  that  verse.  This  is  what  we  \nget: \n\n1 1 19 786 2 17 581 3 12 618 4 11 241 5 19 836 6 18 1072 7 43 6009 \n\na multiple of 19. \n\n[6]  Instead  of  the  gematrical  values  of  every  verse,  let  us  write  down  the \ngematrical values of every individual letter in Sura 1.

            "1": "Appendix 15 \n\n433 \n\nThe Obligatory Charity (Zakat) \n\nZakat  must  be  given  away  \u201con  the  day  of  harvest\u201d  (6:141).  Whenever  we  \nreceive  \u201cnet  income,\u201d  we  must  set  aside  2.5%  and  give  it  to  the  specified \nrecipients\u2014the  parents,  relatives,  orphans,  the  poor,  and  the  traveling  alien,  in         \nthis  order  (2:215).  The  vital  importance  of  Zakat  is  reflected  in  God\u2019s  law:  \u201cMy   \nmercy  encompasses  all  things,  but  I  will  specify  it  for  the  righteous  who  give  \nZakat\u201d (7:156). \n\nZakat  must  be  carefully  calculated  and  given  away  on  a  regular  basis  when-            \n\never we receive any income. Government taxes should be deducted, but not other \nexpenses  such  as  debts,  mortgages,  and  living  expenses.  If  one  does  not  know \nneedy persons, he or she may give the Zakat to a mosque or charitable organization \nwith  the  distinct  purpose  of  helping  poor  people.  Charities  given  to  mosques  or \nhospitals or organizations cannot be considered Zakat. \n\nThe full details of fasting are given in 2:183-187. \n\nFasting \n\nPilgrimage: Hajj & \u2018Umrah \nOnce  in  a  lifetime,  Hajj  and  \u2018Umrah  are  decreed  for  those  who  can  afford  it. \nPilgrimage  commemorates  Abraham\u2019s  exemplary  submission  to  God  (Appendix       \n9),  and  must  be  observed  during  the  four  Sacred  Months\u2014Zul-Hijjah,  Muhar-         \nram,  Safar,  &  Rabi\u2018  I  (12th,  1st,  2nd,  3rd  months)  (2:197;  9:2,  36).  \u2018Umrah  can  be \nobserved  any  time.  Like  all  other  duties  in  Islam,  Hajj  has  been  distorted.  Most \nMuslims  observe  Hajj  only  during  a  few  days  in  Zul-Hijjah,  and  they  consider     \nRajab,  Zul-Qi\u2019dah,  Zul-Hijjah,  and  Muharram  (7th,  11th,  12th,  1st  months)  to  be          \nthe Sacred Months. This is a distortion that is strongly condemned (9:37). \n\nThe  pilgrimage  begins  with  a  bath  or  shower,  followed  by  a  state  of  sanctity    \ncalled  \u201cIhraam,\u201d  where  the  male  pilgrim  wears  seamless  sheets  of  material,  and      \nthe  woman  wears  a  modest  dress  (2:196).  Throughout  Hajj,  the  pilgrim  abstains            \nfrom  sexual  intercourse,  vanities  such  as  shaving  and  cutting  the  hair,  arguments, \nmisconduct,  and  bad  language  (2:197).  Cleanliness,  bathing,  and  regular  hygiene \npractices  are  encouraged.  Upon  arrival  at  the  Sacred  Mosque  in  Mecca,  the    \npilgrim  walks  around  the  Ka\u2018bah  seven  times,  while  glorifying  and  praising  God    \n(2:125,  22:26-29).  The  common  formula  is:  \u201cLabbayka  Allaahumma  Labbayk\u201d     \n(My  God,  I  have  responded  to  You).  \u201cLabbayka  Laa  Shareeka  Laka  Labbayk\u201d  (I    \nhave  responded  to  You,  and  I  proclaim  that  there  is  no  other  god  besides  You;  I     \nhave  responded  to  You).  The  next  step  is  to  walk  the  half-mile  distance  between     \nthe  knolls  of  Safa  and  Marwah  seven  times,  with  occasional  trotting  (2:158).  This \ncompletes the \u2018Umrah portion of the pilgrimage. \n\nThe  pilgrim  then  goes  to  \u2018Arafat  to  spend  a  day  of  worship,  meditation,  and \nglorification  of  God,  from  dawn  to  sunset  (2:198).  After  sunset,  the  pilgrim  goes      \nto  Muzdalifah  where  the  Night  Prayer  is  observed,  and  21  pebbles  are  picked  up        \nfor  the  symbolic  stoning  of  Satan  at  Mina.  From  Muzdalifah,  the  pilgrim  goes  to    \nMina  to  spend  two  or  three  days  (2:203).  On  the  first  morning  at  Mina,  the    \npilgrim  offers  an  animal  sacrifice  to  feed  the  poor  and  to  commemorate  God\u2019s \nintervention to save Ismail and Abraham from Satan\u2019s trick (37:107, Appendix \n\n\f"

The  stoning  ceremonies  symbolize  rejection  of  Satan\u2019s  polytheism  and  are \ndone  by  throwing  seven  pebbles  at  each  of  three  stations,  while  glorifying  God \n(15:34). The pilgrim then returns to Mecca and observes a farewell circumvolu-\ntion of the Ka\u2018bah seven times. \n\nUnfortunately, most of today\u2019s Muslim pilgrims make it a custom to visit the \nprophet Muhammad\u2019s tomb where they commit the most flagrant acts of idolatry \nand  thus  nullify  their  Hajj.  The  Quran  consistently  talks  about  \u201cThe  Sacred \nMosque,\u201d  while  today\u2019s  Muslims  talk  about  \u201cThe  Two  Sacred  Mosques\u201d!  In  a \nglaring  act  of  idolatry,  the  Muslims  have  set  up  Muhammad\u2019s  tomb  as  another \n\u201cSacred Mosque\u201d! This is a blasphemous violation of the Quran, and, ironically, \neven violates Hadith. The Hadith shown below illustrates this strange irony: \n\nTranslation of this false statement: \u201cGod has cursed the Jews and Christians          \nfor turning the tombs of their prophets into mosques.\u201d                                 \n   [Bukhari, Nawawi Edition, Vol. 6, Page 14] \n\nPhysical Benefits \nIn addition to their invaluable spiritual benefits, there is a plethora of physi-\ncal,  economic,  and  health  benefits  from  observing  the  contact  prayers  (Salat), \nobligatory charity (Zakat), fasting during the month of Ramadan, and Hajj. \n\nObserving  the  Dawn  prayer  interrupts  long  periods  of  stillness  during  sleep; \nthis is now proven to help prevent arthritis. Also, getting up early in the morning \nhelps  combat  depression  and  other  psychological  problems.  The  prostration \nposition which is repeated during the contact prayers expands the blood vessels  \nin  our  brains  to  accommodate  more  blood,  and  this  prevents  headaches.  The \nrepeated bending of the back and the joints is a healthful exercise. All these are \nscientifically established facts. \n\nThe  ablutions  required  prior  to  the  contact  prayers  encourage  us  to  use  the \ntoilet  more  frequently.  This  habit  protects  us  from  a  common  and  devastating \ncancer, colon cancer. Harmful chemicals are excreted in the urine and fecal mat-\nter.  If  these  excretions  are  kept  in  the  colon  for  prolonged  periods  of  time,  the \nharmful materials are re-absorbed into the body, and cause cancer. \n\nFasting  during  the  month  of  Ramadan  restores  our  expanded  stomachs  to  \ntheir  normal  sizes,  lowers  our  blood  pressure  through  temporary  dehydration,  \nrids  the  body  of  harmful  toxins,  gives  our  kidneys  a  much  needed  rest,  and \nreduces our weight by removing excessive and harmful fat. \n\nZakat  charity  and  Hajj  pilgrimage  have  far  reaching  economic  and  social \n\nbenefits. \n\n \n\f"

The \nupholding  of  any  prohibitions  not  specifically  mentioned  in  the  Quran  is  tan-   \ntamount  to  idolatry  (6:142-152).  Such  prohibitions  represent  some  other  god(s) \nbesides  God.  If  you  worship  God  ALONE,  you  will  uphold  His  teachings \nALONE and honor the commandments and prohibitions instituted only by Him. \n\nThe  absolute  specificity  of  dietary  prohibitions  in  the  Quran  is  best  illustrated        \nin  6:145-146.  We  learn  from  these  two  verses  that  when  God  prohibits  \u201cmeat,\u201d        \nHe  prohibits  \u201cmeat\u201d  and  nothing  else,  and  when  He  prohibits  \u201cfat,\u201d  that  is  what          \nHe  specifically  prohibits.  These  two  verses  inform  us  that  \u201cthe  meat\u201d  of  pigs  is \nprohibited,  not  \u201cthe  fat.\u201d  Obviously,  God  knew  that  in  many  countries,  lard     \nwould  be  used  in  baked  goods  and  other  food  products,  and  that  such  usage      \ndoes  not  render  the  foods  Haraam  (prohibited).  The  Quran  specifically  prohibits      \nfour meats (2:173, 5:3, 6:142-145, and 16:112): \n\nSay, \u201cI do not find in what was revealed to me \nanything prohibited for any eater \nunless it is (1) carrion, (2) running blood, \n(3)  the meat of pigs, for it is unclean, and \n(4)  meat blasphemously dedicated to other than God.\u201d                 \nIf one is forced to eat these \nwithout being malicious or deliberate, \nthen your Lord is Forgiver, Most Merciful. \n\n[ 6:145 ] \n\n**************************** \n\nAppendix 17 \nDeath \n\nDeath  is  a  great  mystery  to  most  people.  Not  so  for  the  students  of  the    \n\nQuran.  We  learn  that  death  is  exactly  like  sleeping;  complete  with  dreams  (6:60, \n40:46).  The  period  between  death  and  resurrection  passes  like  one  night  of  sleep \n(2:259; 6:60; 10:45; 16:21; 18:11, 19, 25; 30:55). \n\nAt  the  moment  of  death,  everyone  knows  his  or  her  destiny;  Heaven  or  Hell.      \nFor  the  disbelievers,  death  is  a  horrible  event;  the  angels  beat  them  on  the  faces       \nand rear ends as they snatch away their souls (8:50, 47:27, 79:1). \n\nConsistently,  the  Quran  talks  about  two  deaths,  the  first  death  took  place      \nwhen  we  failed  to  make  a  stand  with  God\u2019s  absolute  authority  (Appendix  7).     \nThat  first  death  lasted  until  we  were  born  into  this  world.  The  second  death \nterminates our life in this world (2:28, 22:66, 40:11). \n\nNote: The following is a reproduction of the lead article from the February, 1990 \nissue of the Submitters Perspective, the montly bulletin of United Submitters Inter- \n\n\f"

(44:56) \n\nHe  was  told,  \u201cEnter  Paradise.\u201d  He  said,  \u201cI  wish  my  people \n(on  earth)  know;  that  my  Lord  has  forgiven  me  and \nhonored me.\u201d (36:26-27) \n\nAs  stated  in  3:81  and  46:9, \n\nMY OWN EXPERIENCE \n\nof \n\nfor \n\nGod\u2019s  Messenger \nthe    \nCovenant  does  not  bring  any-   \nthing  new;  everything  I  receive     \nand  pass  on  to  you  is  already  in      \nthe  Quran.

Heaven  has \nbeen  in  existence  since  Adam     \nand  Eve.  We  learn  from  89:27-      \n30 \nthe     \nbelievers\u2019  souls:  \u201cEnter  My \nParadise.\u201d \n\nthat  God \n\ninvites \n\nleave \n\nto \n\nWhen  God\u2019s  covenant  with \nthe  prophets  was  fulfilled  in  ac-\ncordance  with  3:81,  I  was  taken   \nto  Heaven  where  the  righteous  \nlive  NOW  (4:69).  While  my  \nbody  was  down  here  on  earth,  I \nwas  in  the  same  Paradise  of \nAdam & Eve. \n\nTHE DISBELIEVERS \nAs  for  the  disbelievers,  they \nknow  at  the  moment  of  death \nthat  they  are  destined  for  Hell. \nThe  angels  beat  them  up  on  the \nfaces  and  rear  ends  (8:50  & \n47:27),  order  them  to  evict  their \nsouls  (6:93),  then  \u201csnatch  their \nsouls\u201d \n(79:1).  The  Quran  \nteaches  that  the  disbelievers  go \nthrough  2  deaths  (2:28  &  40:11). \nThey  will  be  put  to  death  \u2014  a \nstate  of  nothingness  during \nwhich they see Hell day and \n\nnight  in  a  continuous  nightmare \nthat  lasts  until  the  Day  of  Judg-\nment  (40:46).

To  Him  belongs  the  past,  present, \nand  the  future.  Your  Lord  never  forgets.\u201d  God  did  not  forget,  for  example,  to    \ntell us how to sleep (18:109, 31:27). Yet, the fabricators of such false doctrine as \nHadith  &  Sunna  have  come  up  with  religious  teachings  dictating  to  their  fol-\nlowers  how  to  sleep,  and  even  how  to  cut  your  nails.  The  Sacred  Mosque  in \nMecca and the illegal \u201cSacred Mosque\u201d of Medina, hire some individuals to seek \nout  the  exhausted  visitors  and  beat  them  with  a  stick  if  they  fall  asleep  on  the \nwrong side! \n\nThe  Quran  proclaims  that  the  Quran  is  complete,  perfect,  and  fully  detailed \n(6:19, 38, 114, 115; 50:45), and that religious regulations not specifically instituted \nin  the  Quran  constitute  a  religion  other  than  Islam,  i.e.,  Submission  (42:21, \n17:46).  The  true  believers  uphold  the  Quran,  the  whole  Quran,  and  nothing  but \nthe Quran. This principle is confirmed by the Quran\u2019s mathematical code. Verse \n46  of  Sura  17  proclaims  that  we  shall  uphold  the  Quran  ALONE.  The  word \n\u201cALONE\u201d occurs in the Quran 6 times: 7:70, 17:46, 39:45, 40: 12 & 84, and 60:4. \nAll these occurrences refer to God, except 17:46. When we add the numbers of \nsuras and verses which refer to \u201cGOD ALONE,\u201d we get 361, 19x19. This proves \nthat 17:46 refers to \u201cthe Quran ALONE.\u201d \n\n**************************** \n\nAppendix 19  \nHadith & Sunna: Satanic Innovations \n\nWhich Hadith, other than God and His revelations, do they uphold? \n\n[45:6]  \n\nThe Quran is not a fabricated Hadith; ...it details everything. \n\n[12:111]  \n\nSome people uphold vain Hadith to divert others from the path of God. \n\n[31:6]  \n\nThe only Sunna to follow shall be God\u2019s Sunna. \n\n[17:77, 33:62, 48:23, 6:114] \n\nThe  Quran  informs  us  that  some  enemies  of  the  Prophet,  described  as   \n\n\u201chuman  and  jinn  devils,\u201d  will  fabricate  lies  and  attribute  them  to  the  Prophet \n(6:112,  25:31).

The  prophet  Muhammad  was  enjoined,  in  very   \nstrong words, from issuing any religious teachings besides the Quran (69:38-48). \n\nSome  Muslims  compromise:  \u201cIf  a  Hadith  agrees  with  the  Quran  we  will  ac-          \n\ncept  it,  and  if  it  contradicts  the  Quran,  we  will  reject  it!\u201d  Such  premise  proves       \nthat  these  people  do  not  believe  God\u2019s  assertions  that  the  Quran  is  \u201ccomplete,   \nperfect  and  fully  detailed.\u201d  The  moment  they  seek  guidance  from  anything  be-            \nsides  the  Quran,  no  matter  how  \u201cright\u201d  it  seems,  they  fall  into  Satan\u2019s  trap  (see    \n63:1).  For  they  have  rejected  God\u2019s  word  and  set  up  another  god  besides  God   \n(18:57). See Appendix 33. \n\nThe  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  miracle  provides  mathematical  evidence  that  the    \n\nQuran shall be our only source of religious teachings. Here are just 2 examples: \n\n1.  \u201c     \n\n2. \u201c     \n\nof this book,\u201d is in Verse 38 (19x2) and consists of 19 Arabic letters (6:38). \n\n                  =  We  did  not  leave  anything  out                    \n\ndetailed,\u201d is in Verse 114 (19x6) and consists of 19 Arabic letters (6:114). \n\n                  =  He  sent  down  this  book  fully                    \n\n********************* \nAppendix 20 \nQuran: Unlike Any Other Book \n\nThe  Quran  is  God\u2019s  Final  Testament  to  the  world,  and  He  has  pledged  to     \n\nprotect  it  from  the  slightest  distortion  (15:9).  Thus,  the  Quran  is  surrounded  by \ninvisible forces that guard it and serve it (13:39, 41:42, 42:24). \n\nUnlike  any  other  book,  the  Quran  is  taught  by  God  (55:1-2);  He  teaches  us     \nwhat  we  need  at  the  time  we  need  it.  This  is  why  we  read  the  Quran  hundreds  of   \ntimes  without  getting  bored.  We  can  read  a  novel,  for  example,  only  once.  But      \nthe  Quran  can  be  read  an  infinite  number  of  times,  and  we  derive  new  and   \nvaluable  information  from  it  every  time.  On  the  other  hand,  the  insincere     \nreaders\u2014those  who  read  the  Quran  to  find  fault  with  it\u2014are  diverted  from  the      \nQuran  (7:146,  17:45,  18:57,  41:44).  In  fact,  God\u2019s  invisible  forces  help  them  find      \nthe  faults  they  seek.  Since  the  Quran  is  perfect,  such  \u201cfaults\u201d  serve  only  to  reveal        \nthe stupidity of God\u2019s enemies. \n\nGod  uses  His  own  attributes  to  describe  the  Quran;  He  calls  the  Quran             \n\n\u201c  \u2018Azeem  =  Great\u201d  (15:87),  \u201cHakeem  =  Full  of  wisdom\u201d  (36:2),  \u201cMajid  = \nGlorious\u201d (50:1), and \u201cKarim = Honorable\u201d (56:77). What can we say? \n\nSince  the  Quran  is  God\u2019s  message  to  all  the  people,  regardless  of  their  lan-    \nguage,  the  Quran  is  accessible  to  the  believers,  regardless  of  their  language   \n(41:44).  This  explains  a  profound  phenomenon:  the  believers  who  do  not  know   \nArabic  know  the  Quran  better  than  the  Arabic  speaking  unbelievers.  Because  of       \nthe  invisible  forces  serving  the  Quran,  it  is  readily  and  enjoyably  accessible  to  the \nsincere believers, and utterly inaccessible to the unbelievers (17:45, 18:57, 56:79). \n\n \n\f"

Satan believed  that his God-given powers  qualified  him  \nto  function  as  an  independent  god.  As  evidenced  by  the  prevalence  of  misery, \ndisease, accidents, and war in his dominion, we now know that Satan is incom-\npetent. \n\nThe  Quran  clearly  states  that  Satan  was  an  angel,  by  virtue  of  the  immense \npowers  and  rank  bestowed  upon  him.  This  is  why  he  is  addressed  as  an  angel \n(2:34, 7:11, 15:29, 17:61,18:50, 20:116, 38:71) prior to his fall. By definition, a jinn \nis a fallen angel (18:50). Satan\u2019s rebellion teaches us that the angels were created \nwith minds of their own, and absolute freedom of choice (2:34). \n\n********************* \n\nAppendix 22 \nJesus \nThe Quran, informs us that Jesus was a human messenger of God whose sole \nmission was to deliver God\u2019s message; he never possessed any power, and is now \ndead (4:171, 5:75, 117). Those who consider Jesus to be God, or Son of God, or \npart of a trinity are \u201cpagans\u201d (5:17, 72, 73). Outstanding Christian scholars have \nreached  these  same  conclusions  (THE  MYTH  OF  GOD  INCARNATE,  John   \nHick,  ed.,  The  Westminster  Press,  Philadelphia,  1977  &  THE  MYTH  MAKER, \nHyam  Maccoby,  Harper  &  Row  1986).  Christianity  is  the  product  of  Nicene   \n(AD 325). \n\nThe Bible\u2019s Jesus \nJesus proclaimed aloud: \u201cWhoever puts faith in me believes not so much in me \nas in him who sent me;.... For I have not spoken on my own; no, the Father \nwho sent me has commanded me what to  say and how to  speak. Since  I know \nthat  his  commandment  means  eternal  life,  whatever  I  say  is  spoken  just  as  he \ninstructed me.\u201d \n\n[ John 12:44-50 ] \n\n\u201cI  cannot  do  anything  of  myself.  I  judge  as  I  hear,  and  my  judgment  is  honest \nbecause I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me.\u201d \n\n[ John 5:30 ] \n\nJesus said: \u201cMy doctrine is not my own; it comes from him who sent me.\u201d \n\n[ John 7:16 ] \n\n\u201cMen  of  Israel,  listen  to  me!  Jesus  the  Nazorean  was  a  man  whom  God  sent  to   \nyou  with  miracles,  wonders,  and  signs  as  his  credentials.

The evidence \npresented in this  Appendix  incontrovertibly  removes  these human  injec-\ntions, restores the Quran to its pristine purity, and illustrates a major func-\ntion of the Quran\u2019s mathematical code, namely, to protect the Quran from \nthe  slightest  tampering.  Thus,  the  code  rejects  ONLY  the  false  injections \n9:128-129. \n\nSurely, we have revealed this scripture, and surely, we will preserve it. \n\n [ 15:9 ] \n\nThe Quran is God\u2019s Final Testament. Hence the divine pledge to keep it per-\nfectly  preserved.  To  assure  us  of  both  the  divine  authorship,  and  the  perfect \npreservation  of  the  Quran,  the  Almighty  author  has  rendered  the  Quran  mathe-\nmatically  composed.  As  proven  by  the  physical  evidence  in  Appendix  1,  such \nmathematical composition is far beyond human capabilities. The slightest viola-\ntion of God\u2019s Final Testament is destined to stand out in glaring disharmony. A \ndeviation  by  only  1\u2014one  sura,  one  verse,  one  word,  even  one  letter\u2014is  immedi-\nately exposed. \n\nNineteen  years  after  the  Prophet  Muhammad\u2019s  death,  during  the  reign  of \nKhalifa  \u2018Uthman,  a  committee  of  scribes  was  appointed  to  make  several  copies   \nof  the  Quran  to  be  dispatched  to  the  new  Muslim  lands.  The  copies  were  to  be \nmade from the original Quran which was written by Muhammad\u2019s hand (Appen-\ndix 28). \n\nThis committee was supervised by \u2018Uthman Ibn \u2018Affaan, \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb, \nZeid  Ibn  Thaabet,  Ubayy  Ibn  Ka\u2018ab,  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  Al-Zubair,  Sa\u2018eed  Ibn  Al-  \n\u2018Aas, and \u2018Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Haareth Ibn Heshaam. The Prophet, of course, \nhad  written  the  Quran  in  its  chronological  order  of  revelation  (Appendix  23), \ntogether  with  the  necessary  instructions  to  place  every  piece  in  its  proper  posi-\ntion. The  last  sura revealed in Medina was Sura 9. Only  Sura 110, a very short \nsura, was revealed after Sura 9, in Mina. \n\nThe  committee  of  scribes  finally  came  to  Sura  9,  and  put  it  in  its  proper   \n\nplace.  One  of  the  scribes  suggested  adding  a  couple  of  verses  to  honor  the \nProphet. The majority of scribes agreed. \u2018Ali was outraged. He vehemently main-\ntained  that  the  word  of  God,  written  down  by  the  hand  of  His  final  prophet,    \nmust never be altered. \n\n \n\f"

This  apparent  victory  for    \nGod\u2019s enemies was, of course, in accordance with God\u2019s will. In just two decades \nafter the Prophet\u2019s death, the idol worshipers who were defeated by the Prophet  \nin  the  conquest  of  Mecca  (632  AD)  reverted  to  idolatry.  Ironically,  this  time \naround  their  idol  was  the  Prophet  himself.  Such  idol  worshipers  obviously  did  \nnot deserve to possess the pure Quran. Hence the blessed martyrdom of the true \nbelievers  who  tried  to  restore  the  Quran,  and  the  apparent  victory  for  the  dis-\ntorters of God\u2019s word. \n\nThe  first  peace  time  ruler  after  this  lengthy  and  disastrous  war  was  Marwan \nIbn  Al  Hakam  (died 65 AH/684  AD).  One  of  the  first  duties  he performed  was   \nto  destroy  the  original  Quran,  the  one  that  was  so  scrupulously  written  by  the \nProphet\u2019s own hand, \u201cfearing it might become the cause of NEW disputes\u201d [see \n\u2018ULUM  AL-QURAN,  by  Ahmad  von  Denffer,  Islamic  Foundation,  Leicester, \nUnited Kingdom, 1983, Page 56]. The question an intelligent person must ask is: \n\u201cIf  the  original  Quran  were  identical  to  the  Quran  in  circulation  at  that  time,    \nwhy did Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam have to destroy it?!\u201d \n\nUpon examining the oldest Islamic references, we realize that the false injec-\ntions, 9:128-129, were always suspect. For example, we read in Bukhary\u2019s famous \nHadith, and Al-Suyuty\u2019s famous Itqaan, that every single verse in the Quran was \nverified by a multiplicity of witnesses \u201cexcept Verses 128 and 129 of Sura 9; they \n\n \n \n\f"

            "1": "Appendix 24 \n\n447 \n\noccurrence  of  this  word  in  the  Quran  is  95,  19x5.  The  inclusion  of  9:128-129 \ncauses this word to increase by 1, to 96. \n\n[8]  The  INDEX  TO  THE  WORDS  OF  THE  QURAN,  lists  116  \u201cRasool\u201d \n(Messenger) words. One of these words is in 9:128. By removing this false verse, \n115  \u201cRasool\u201d  words  remain.  Another  \u201cRasool\u201d  word  which  must  be  excluded \nfrom counting is in 12:50, since it refers to the \u201cmessenger of Pharaoh,\u201d not the \nmessenger of God. Thus, the total occurrence of \u201cRasool\u201d of God is 114, 19x6. \n\n[9]  Another  important  word  that  occurs  in  the  false  Verses  9:128-129  is  the \nword  \u201cRaheem\u201d  (Merciful).  This  word  is  used  in  the  Quran  exclusively  as  a   \nname of God, and its total count is 114,19x6, after removing the word \u201cRaheem\u201d \nof 9:128, which refers to the prophet. According to 7:188, 10:49, and 72:21 the \nProphet did not possess any power of mercy. \n\n[10]  The  INDEX  lists  22  occurrences  of  the  word  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  (Throne).  After \nremoving  the  false  injection  9:129,  and  the  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  of  Joseph  which  occurs  in \n12:100,  and  the  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  of  the  Queen  of  Sheba  (27:23),  we  end  up  with  19           \n\u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  words.  This  proves  that  the  word  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  of  9:129  does  not  belong  in     \nthe Quran. \n\n[11] The Quranic command \u201cQul\u201d (Say) occurs in the Quran 332 times. Also, \nthe word \u201cQaaloo\u201d (They said) occurs the same number of times, 332. Since the \nfalse  Verse  9:129  contains  the  word  \u201cQul\u201d  (Say),  its  inclusion  would  have \ndestroyed this typical Quranic phenomenon. \n\n[12] The Quran contains 6234 numbered verses and 112 un-numbered verses \n(Basmalahs). Thus, the total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, 19x334. The \nfalse Verses 9:128-129 violate this important criterion of the Quran\u2019s code. \n\n[13] In addition to violating the numbers of words as listed above, 9:128-129 \nviolate the Quran\u2019s mathematical structure. When we add the number of verses in \neach sura, plus the sum of verse numbers (1 + 2 + 3 +... + n, where n = number   \nof  verses),  plus  the  number  of  each  sura, \nthe  cumulative  total  for  the  whole  Quran \ncomes  to  346199,  or  19x19x959.  This \nphenomenon  confirms  the  authenticity  of \nevery  verse  in the Quran,  while  excluding \n9:128-129.  Table  3  is  an  abbreviated  il-\nlustration  of  the  calculations  of  Item  13. \nThis  phenomenon  is  impossible  if  the  \nfalse Verses 9:128-129 are included. \n\n  Table 3: Mathematical coding of the   \nQuran\u2019s suras & verses, based on \u201c19\u201d. \n\nSura    No. of   Sum of  \n No.    Verses    Verse #\u2019s    Total \n  1          7 \n36 \n          28 \n    41329 \n  2        286         41041 \n        . \n   .   \n     8264 \n  9        127          8128 \n        . \n            .  \n   .   \n  . \n      141 \n          21 \n 114        6 \n6555    6234        333410    346199 \n\n[14]  When  we  carry  out  the  same  cal-\nculations  as  in  Item  13  above,  but  for  the \n85  un-initialed  suras  only,  which  include \nSura 9, the cumulative total is also a mul-\ntiple  of  19.  The  cumulative  total  for  all  \nun-initialed suras is 156066, or 19x8214. This result depends on the fact that Sura \n9 consists of 127 verses, not 129. The data are shown in Table 4.

The  details  are  shown  in \nTable 9. \n\nThe  inclusion  of  Sura  9  with  the  wrong \nnumber  of  verses,  129,  would  have  altered \nboth  the  sum  of  verse  numbers  and  the \ncumulative  total\u2014the  sum  of  verse  numbers \nwould have become 627 + 129 = 756, and the \ncumulative  total  would  not  be  23655\u2014and   \nthe  Quran\u2019s  code  would  have  been  violated \n(Table 9). \n\n[21]  The  false  injection  consisted  of  Ver-\nses  128  and  129  at  the  end  of  Sura  9.  If  we \nlook  at  the  numbers  128  and  129,  we  see  two \nl\u2019s,  two  2\u2019s,  one  8,  and  one  9.  Now  let  us  \nlook  at  all  the  verses  in  the  Quran,  and   \ncount  all  the  l\u2019s  we  see.  This  means  the  l\u2019s  \nwe  see  in  verses  1,  10,  11,  12,  13...  21,  31, \nand  so  on.  The  total  count  of  the  l\u2019s  is  2546 \n(19x134),  provided  the  correct  number  of \nverses  in  Sura  9,  127,  is  used.  If  128  and  129 \nare included, the grand total becomes 2548, \nwhich  is  not  a \nTable 10: Counting all the 1\u2019s \nmultiple  of  19 \nin the 85 un-initialed suras. \n(Table 11). \n\n1 \n\n      115 \n\nSura    # of Verse    # of 1\u2019s \n   1   \n   4   \n   . \n   9   \n   . \n 113  \n 114  \n                               \u2026\u2026\u2026. \n\n . \n       61 \n . \n1 \n1 \n\n   7   \n 176  \n    .   \n 127  \n    .   \n   5   \n   6   \n\n    1406 \n                              (19x74) \n\n[22]  Since \nSura  9  is  an \nu n -i ni t i a l e d  \nsura, \nlet  us \nlook  at  all  the \nverse  numbers \nin  the  85  un-\ninitialed  suras \nand  count  all \nthe l\u2019s we see. \n\n No. of \nSura     No. of     add up \n  Total \n to 10 \n No.     Verses \n   148 \n   12  \n   9         127  \n   129 \n   10  \n109  \n  10  \n   145 \n   11  \n123  \n  11  \n   133 \n   10  \n111  \n  12  \n    59 \n    3  \n 43   \n  13  \n    70 \n    4  \n 52   \n  14  \n   123 \n    9  \n 99   \n  15  \n   156 \n   12  \n128  \n  16  \n   138 \n   10  \n111  \n  17  \n   138 \n   10  \n110  \n  18  \n   126 \n    9  \n 98   \n  19  \n   167 \n   12  \n135  \n  20  \n   143 \n   10  \n112  \n  21  \n   107 \n    7  \n 78   \n  22  \n   152 \n   11  \n118  \n  23  \n    94 \n    6  \n 64   \n  24  \n   109 \n    7  \n 77   \n  25  \n   275 \n   22  \n227  \n  26  \n    58 \n    2  \n 29   \n  27  \n 342       1951 \n  2470 \n  177 \n 342 = 19x18    &   2470 = 19x130 \n\nTable 9: All the suras whose number \nof verses ends with \u201c9.\u201d \n\nNo. of \n\n  Sum of \n\nSura \n No.        Verses    Verse #s    Total \n    5995       6114 \n 10   \n    4950       5064 \n 15   \n    2415       2513 \n 29   \n    4005       4137 \n 43   \n    1770       1873 \n 44   \n     435         512   \n 48   \n    1225       1326 \n 52   \n      521 \n     435 \n 57   \n      545 \n     435 \n 81   \n      291 \n     190 \n 82   \n      296 \n     190 \n 87   \n      305 \n     190 \n 96   \n      45 \n104  \n      158 \n   22280     23655 \n748  \n              (19x1245) \n\n  109 \n   99  \n   69  \n   89  \n   59  \n   29  \n   49  \n   29  \n   29  \n   19  \n   19  \n   19  \n    9  \n  627 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

Obviously, if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, we would see two \nadditional l\u2019s, from 128 and 129, and the code would be violated. \n\n[23]  Following  the  same  process  explained  in  Items  22  and  23  for  the  digit \n\u201c1,\u201d  let  us  count  all  the  2\u2019s,  8\u2019s  and  9\u2019s  in  all  the  verse  numbers  of  the  whole \nQuran. As shown in Table 11, the total count of all the 2\u2019s, 8\u2019s, and 9\u2019s is 3382, or \n19x178. This makes the grand total of all the l\u2019s, 2\u2019s, 8\u2019s, and 9\u2019s 2546 + 3382       \n= 5928, 19x312. \n\nTable 11: Counting the digits that make up 128 and 129 in the whole Quran. \n\nSura      # of 1\u2019s      # of 2\u2019s      # of 8\u2019s \n  1   \n  2   \n  . \n  9   \n 10   \n  . \n114  \n\n    1  \n  159 \n    .   \n   61 \n   31 \n    .   \n    1  \n\n# of 9\u2019s   \n     0 \n    48 \n     .  \n    22 \n    21 \n     .  \n     0 \n\n0 \n      55 \n       . \n      22 \n      21 \n       . \n       0 \n    \u2026\u2026.                \u2026\u2026. \n   833 \n     908   \n\n  1   \n       146  \n  . \n 31   \n 21   \n  . \n  1   \n      \u2026\u2026. \n1641 \n\nTotal \n   2 \n 408 \n   . \n 136 \n  94 \n   . \n   2   \n                    \u2026\u2026. \n5928 \n\n       \u2026\u2026. \n       2546 \n   (19 x 134)  \n\n         (19x 312)   \n\nIn  this  remarkable  phenomenon,  we  considered  every  single  verse  in  the \nQuran,  and  examined  the  individual  digits  that  make  up  Verses  128  and  129. \nSince 128 and 129 contain 6 digits, the inclusion of these human injections causes \nthe total count of these digits in the whole Quran to be 5928 + 6 = 5934, not a \nmultiple of 19. \n\n[24] The total count of all the digits (1 through 9) in all the verse numbers of \n\nthe 85 un-initialed suras, including Sura 9 with 127 verses, is 27075, or 19x19x75. \n\n[25] Adding up the digits of the Quran\u2019s suras and verses produces a  multi-     \n\n  Table 12: Sum of digits of all suras  \n & verse numbers in the whole Quran. \n\nple of 19, provided the correct number of verses for Sura 9, 127, is taken. To do \nthis,  you  make  a  list  of  the  Quran\u2019s  114   \nsuras  and  the  number  of  verses  in  each    \nsura.  Add  the  digits  of  every  sura  number. \nThe sum of digits of 10 = 1, 11 = 2, 12 = 3, \n99  =  18,  and  so  on.  The  total  for  all  the  \nsuras is 975. The same thing is done for the \nnumbers  of  verses  in  every  sura.  For  ex-\nample,  Sura  2  consists  of  286  verses.  The \ndigits of 286 add up to 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. For \nSura  9,  the  digits  of  its  number  of  verses  \nadd up to 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. The total for all \n114  suras  is  906.  Thus,  the  grand  total  for \nthe sum of digits of all the suras and verses \nis  975  +  906  =  1881  =  19x99.

            "1": "Appendix 24 \n\n451 \n\nSura 9 consisted of 129 verses. Table 12 is abbreviated to illustrate the calcula-\ntions. \n\n[26]  Miraculously,  if  we  calculate  the  sum  of  digits  for  every  sura  in  the \nQuran, and multiply the sum for each sura by the sum of digits of its number of \nverses, instead of adding, we still end up with a grand total that is a multiple of \n19. For example, Sura 2 has 286 verses. The sum of digits of 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. So you \nmultiply 2 by 16, and you get 32, instead of adding 2 +16 as we did in Item 26. \nThis  is  done  for  every  sura  in  the  Quran.  The  grand  total  for  all  the  suras  is    \n7771, or 19x409. Once again, every single verse in the Quran is confirmed, while \nthe false verses are utterly rejected.

            "1": "452 \nverses is also odd, let us look at all the odd-num-\nbered suras whose number of verses is also odd. \nThis gives us 27 suras: 1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 25, 27, \n29, 33, 35, 39, 43, 45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 91, 93, 97, 101, \n103, 105,107, 111, and 113. They consist of 7, 127, \n123, 43, 99, 111, 77, 93, 69, 73, 45, 75, 89, 37, 29, \n11, 29, 19, 15, 11, 5, 11, 3, 5, 7, 5, and 5 verses, \nrespectively. The sum of these sura numbers, plus \ntheir sum of verse numbers is 2774, 19x146. If we \ntake the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 , i.e., \n129, this miracle disappears. \n\nAppendix 24 \n\nTable 15: Mathematical coding \nof all suras consisting of 127 \nverses or less. \n\n        8 \n\n  Sura \n    No. of \nNumber   Verses      Total \n    1  \n    5  \n    8  \n    9  \n        . \n    .   \n      118   \n    113 \n    114 \n      120 \n    6434       4529    10963 \n\n      7 \n      120        125 \n      75 \n       83 \n      127        136 \n       . \n      5 \n      6 \n\n[30] The correct number of verses in Sura 9 is \n127,  and  this  is  a  prime  number\u2014it  is  not \ndivisible by any number except 1, and itself. Let \nus look at all the suras whose number of verses is \na prime number. These are Suras 1, 9, 13, 33, 43, \n45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, \nand 113.

If you add the digits of these suras, \nyou get 137, while the digits of the verses add up to 129.

The total of \nthese sura numbers is 71, and the total number of \nverses is 765. This produces a grand total of 71 + \n765 = 836, or 19x44.

There  are  three \nother  suras  in  the  whole  Quran  whose  sura  \ndigits add up to 9 and the digits of their number \nof  verses  add  up  to  10.  These  are  suras  9,  45,  \n54, and 72.

If  Sura  9  had  129 \nverses, it would have been included in this \ngroup,  and  the  total  would  have  been     \n646 + 129 + 9 = 784, which is not a multi-\nple of 19. \n\n[41] By now, it is incontrovertibly prov-\nen  that  Sura  9  consists  of  127  verses.  Let \nus now look at the suras whose number of \nverses  ends  with  \u201c7.\u201d  There  are  7  such \nsuras;  they  are  Suras  1,  9,  25,  26,  45,  86, \nand  107.  Their  numbers  of  verses  are  7, \n127, 77, 227, 37, 17, and 7 verses, respec-\ntively.  The  grand  total  of  sura  numbers \nplus  number  of  verses  for  these  seven  \nsuras is 798, 19x42. The details are shown \nin Table 25. Thus, every sura whose num-\nber  of  verses  ends  with  the  digit  \u201c7,\u201d  in-\ncluding Sura 9, conforms with the code. \n\n[42]  The  last  two  verses  of  Sura  9  are \n126 and 127. Since the falsifiers added two \nverses, let us look at the last two verses of \nevery  sura  in  the  Quran,  and  count  the  \ndigit \u201c7,\u201d all of them, among these last two \nverses. \n\n455 \n\n  Table 24: Odd numbered suras whose    \n     number of verses ends with \u201c9.\u201d \n\n  Table 25: The suras whose number  \n    of verses ends with the digit \u201c7.\u201d \n\nSura  No. of \n No. \n 15   \n 29   \n 43   \n 57   \n 81   \n 87   \n312  \n\nVerses     Total \n    114 \n   99 \n     98 \n   69 \n    132 \n   89 \n     86 \n   29 \n    110 \n   29 \n    106 \n   19 \n    646 \n  334 \n (19x34) \n\nSura  No. of \n No. \n   1   \n   9   \n  25  \n  26  \n  45  \n  86  \n 107 \n 299 \n\nVerses     Total \n    7  \n  127 \n   77 \n  227 \n   37 \n   17 \n    7  \n  499 \n\n      8 \n    136 \n    102 \n    253 \n     82 \n    103 \n    114 \n    798 \n (19x42) \n\nAs  shown  in  Table  26,  the  total  number  of  the  digit  \u201c7\u201d  among  the  last  two \n\nverses of every sura in the Quran is 38, 19x2. \n\nIf the last verse in Sura 9 was 129 instead of 127, the number of occurrences \n\nof  the  digit  \u201c7\u201d  would  have  been  37,  not  38, \nand this criterion would have been destroyed. \n\n[43]  Assuming  that  Sura  9  consists  of  129 \nverses, let us look at all the suras that contain a \nverse  No.  129.  This  means  that  we  look  at  all \nthe  suras  that  consist  of  129  or  more  verses. \nFor  example,  Sura  2  consists  of  286  verses. \nTherefore,  it  contains  a  verse  that  is  assigned \nthe number \u201c129.\u201d We then take this verse and \nadd it to all the other verses assigned the num-\nber  129  throughout  the  Quran.  Under  this  as-\nsumption, there are 9 suras that contain a verse \nNo. 129. Interestingly, we find that the total of \nsura  numbers  of  these  9  suras  is  a  multiple  of \n19 (114), while the total for the nine 129\u2019s can \nbe a multiple of 19 if 2 is deducted from their \n\n  Table 26: The total number of the \n  digit \u201c7\u201d among the last two   \n  verses of every sura in the Quran. \n\n  7\u2019s in Last 2 \n\n Verses    Verses \n  6,7 \n\n   Sura    Last 2 \n   No \n   1   \n   2       285, 286   \n   3       199, 200   \n   4       175, 176   \n    .   \n   9       126, 127   \n    .   \n   25 \n    .   \n   114 \n\n    .   \n 76, 77   \n    .   \n  5,6 \n\n    .   \n\n1 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n. \n1 \n. \n3 \n. \n0 \n      38 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

The  details  are  in \nTable 27. \n\nWhen we add 114, plus 1161, and remove 2, we \nget 1273, or 19x67. Compare this total (1273) with \nthe  total  reported  in  the  Item  44  below.  Of  the  9 \nsuras listed in Table 27, which one has the extra 2 \nverses? The answer is provided in Item 44. \n\n[44] To pinpoint the location of these two false \nverses,  let  us  look  at  all  the  suras  that  contain  a \nverse  No.  128,  while  continuing  to  assume  that \nSura 9 consists of 129 verses. This will give us the \nsame list of suras as in Table 27, and also bring in \nSura 16 which has precisely 128 verses. \n\nAs shown in Table 28, Sura 9 stands out in glar-\ning  disharmony;  it  is  singled  out  as  the  sura  that \ncontains  the  false  verses.  The  total  of  suras  and \nverses  becomes  divisible  by  19  only  if  Sura  9  is \nremoved. Note that the divisible total, after remov-\ning Sura 9, is 1273, 19x67, which is the same total \nobtained in Item 43 above after removing 2 verses. \nThis  remarkable  phenomenon  proves  that  Sura  9 \ncould not contain a verse No. 128. \n\n[45] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura whose last \ntwo verses are 126 and 127. Let us take the 85 un-\ninitialed  suras,  and  add  up  the  numbers  of  the  last              \ntwo verses in each sura. For example, the last two \nverses in Sura 1 are 6 and 7. Add 6 + 7 and you get \n13. The next un-initialed sura is Sura 4; its last two \nverses are 175 and 176. Add 175 +176 and you get \n351. Do this for all un-initialed suras.

            "1": "Appendix 24 \n\n[47]  Sura  9  consists  of  127  verses, \nand  127  consists  of  3  digits.  Let  us  \nlook  at  all  the  suras  whose  number  of \nverses  consists  of  3  digits;  these  are \nsuras 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, \n17,  18,  20,  21,  23,  26,  and  37.  Their \nverse  numbers  are  286,  200,  176,  120, \n165, 206, 127, 109, 123, 111, 128, 111, \n110,  135,  112,  118,  227,  and  182, \nrespectively.  By  taking  the  last  digit  in \neach  number  of  verses,  and  adding  up \nthese digits, we get 6 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 5 +  \n6 + 7 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 0 + 5 + 2 + 8 \n+ 7 + 2 =76= 19x4. \n\nIf  Sura  9  consisted  of  129  verses, \nthe  last  digit  in  its  number  of  verses \nwould  be  9  instead  of  7,  and  the  total  \nof  last  digits  would  be  78  instead  of  \n76,  and  this  phenomenon  would  dis-\nappear. \n\n[48] Let us look at the list of suras \nshown  in  Item  47  above.  Since  the \nnumber  of  verses  in  Sura  9  is  an  odd \nnumber,  let  us  now  consider  the  odd-\nnumbered  verse  numbers.  There  are  8 \nsuras  with  a  3-digit,  odd  number  of \nverses:  Suras  6,  9,  10,  11,  12,  17,  20, \nand  26.  Their  numbers  of  verses  are \n165,  127,  109,  123,  111,  111,  135,  & \n227. \n\n  Table 30: Sum of digits of the last two \nverses of every sura in the Quran. \n\n457 \n\n  6, 7 \n\n   Sum \n      the Digits \n          6 + 7 \n\n   Sura    Last 2 \n   No.     Verses   \n   1   \n   2       285, 286         2 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 8 + 6 \n   3       199, 200         1 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 0 + 0  \n    .   \n   9       126, 127   \n\n       . \n\n    .   \n\n   113 \n   114 \n\n    .   \n  4, 5 \n  5, 6 \n\n         . \n\n1 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 7 \n. \n    4 + 5 \n    5 + 6 \n\n           \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n    1824 = 19x96 \n\n Table 31: All suras whose number of  \nverses is odd, and consists of 3 digits. \n\nSura  No. of \nNo.  \n6 \n9 \n10   \n11   \n12   \n17   \n20   \n26   \n\n     Last \nVerses       Digit \n  165 \n  127 \n  109 \n  123 \n  111 \n  111 \n  135 \n  227 \n\n 5 \n 7 \n 9  \n 3 \n 1 \n 1 \n 5 \n 7 \n     \u2026\u2026. \n       38 \n   (19x2) \n\nThe last digits in these numbers of \nverses are 5, 7, 9, 3, 1, 1, 5, and 7,  \nrespectively, and the sum of these digits is 38, or 19x2. Obviously, if Sura 9 con-\nsisted of 129 verses, its last digit would be 9, not 7, and the sum of the last digits \nwould be 40, not a multiple of 19. The detailed data are shown in Table 31. Thus, \nwe  are  getting  more  and  more  specific,  as  we  zoom  in  on  the  last  digit  in  the \nnumber of verses. \n\n[49]  Let  us  continue  to  work  with  the  same  group  of  suras  of  Items  47  and   \n\n48. Since Sura 9 is an odd-numbered sura, let us now remove all the even-num-\nbered suras from the list of suras shown in Item 47. Now we have odd-numbered \nsuras,  with  odd-numbered  verses.  There  are  only  three  such  suras  in  the  whole \nQuran: 9, 11, and 17. Their numbers of verses are 127, 123, and 111 (Table 32). If \nSura  9  consisted  of  129  verses,  this  remarkable  phenomenon  would  have  been \ndestroyed. \n\n[50] Let us continue to work with the three suras listed in Item 49.

Just  add  the \nindividual  digits,  and  you  get  1  +  2  +  7  +  1  +              \n2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19. \n\n  Table 32: Odd numbered suras \n  whose number of verses is odd \n  and consists of 3 digits. \nSura No.  No. of Verses \n   9   \n  11  \n  17  \n\n127 \n123 \n111 \n361 \n\nObviously,  this  phenomenon  depends  on  the \nnow proven truth that Sura 9 consists of 127 ver-\nses.  If  Sura  9  consisted  of  129  verses,  the  only \nsuras  in  the  Quran  that  possess  the  above  stated \nqualities would have added up to 1 + 2 + 9 + 1 + 2+ 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21. In other \nwords,  this  important  component  of  the  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  code  would  have \ndisappeared. \n\n   (19x19) \n\n[51]  There  are  three  suras  (1)  whose  numbers  are  odd,  (2)  their  numbers  of   \nverses  are  odd,  and  (3)  the  number  of  verses  consists  of  3  digits.  They  are  Suras:       \n9,  11,  and  17  (see  Items  48  through  50  for  the  flow  of  this  point).  Just  add  the \nindividual  digits \n9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 19. \n\nthat  make  up \n\nthe \n\nthree  sura  numbers,  and  you  get                        \n\n[52] The number 129 is divisible by 3. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses as the \ndistorters  claimed,  then  it  would  be  (1)  an  odd-numbered  sura  that  (2)  consists        \nof  a  3-digit  number  of  verses,  (3)  the  number  of  verses  is  odd,  and  (4)  the  num-      \nber  of  verses  is  divisible  by  3.  There  are  only  two  suras  in  the  whole  Quran  that   \npossess  these  qualities:  Sura  11  with  123  verses,  and  Sura  17  with  111  verses.  The  \nsum  of  digits  of  both  sura  numbers  and  the  numbers  of  verses  comes  to                \n1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19. This can be observed only if Sura 9 con-\nsists of 127 verses. \n\n[53]  Sura  9  is  (1)  odd-numbered,  (2)  its  number  of  verses  is  odd,  (3)  its \nnumber  of  verses  ends  with  the  digit  \u201c7,\u201d  (4)  its  number  of  verses  is  a  prime   \nnumber,  and  (5)  the  sura  number  is  divisible  by  3  &  9.  The  only  two  suras  that    \npossess  these  qualities  are:  Sura  9  (127  verses),  and  Sura  45  (37  verses).  Just  add       \nthe digits you see: \n\n9 + 1 + 2 + 7= 19 & 4 + 5 + 3 + 7= 19; Total for both suras = 19 + 19 = 38. \n\n[54]  Let  us  assume  that  Sura  9  does  have  129  verses.  In  that  case  we  will          \nhave  only  two  suras  in  the  whole  Quran  whose  number  begins  with  9,  and  their           \nnumber  of  verses  ends  with  9:  Sura  9  (129 \nverses)  and  Sura  96  (19  verses).  As   \ndetailed  in  Table  33,  the  grand  total  of    \nsura number, plus the number of verses, plus \nthe  sum  of  verse  numbers  is  8828,  not  a \nmultiple of 19. \n\n  Table 33: Suras whose number begins \n  with \u201c9\u201d and their number of verses \n ends with \u201c9.\u201d \n\n Sura    No. of \n  No.     Verses \n129?  \n   9   \n  19  \n  96  \n 148 \n 105 \n\n  Sum of \n Verse #s   Total \n    8385        8523 \n305 \n     190   \n    8575        8828 \n  (Not multiple of 19) \n\nNow  let  us  remove  the  false  verses  (128        \n\n&  129)  from  Sura  9,  and  repeat  the  same \ncalculations.

Table  37  shows that the last true \nletter in Sura 9 must be \u201cN,\u201d not \u201cM.\u201d \n\nSura     First        Last \n  Total \nNo.      Letter       Letter \n    52 \n     B = 2       N = 50 \n 1 \n    51 \n     A = 1      N = 50 \n 2 \n    51 \n     A = 1      N = 50 \n 3 \n     Y = 10    M = 40 \n 4 \n    50 \n     Y = 10    R = 200     210 \n 5 \n    41 \n     A = 1      M = 40 \n 6 \n     A = 1 \n 7 \nN = 50      51 \n     Y = 10     M = 40      50 \n 8 \n 9 \n      B = 2  N = 50      52 \n           \u2026\u2026\u2026.  \u2026\u2026\u2026..    \u2026\u2026 \n   608 \n\n 38   \n\n  570 \n     (19x2)    (19x30)   (19x32) \n\n[58]  Sister  Ihsan  Ramadan  of  Masjid  Tucson  counted  all  the  suras  in  the \n\nQuran which end with the letter \u201cN\u201d (Noon), the last letter in Sura 9. \n\nShe found that 43 suras end with the same letter as Sura 9 (N)\u2014suras 1, 2, 3, \n7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 46, \n49, 51, 58, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 77, 81, 83, 84, 95, 107, and 109. Just add the \nsura numbers + number of suras that end with \u201cN\u201d, and you get: \n\n1919. \nThus, the last letter in Sura 9 is once again confirmed to be \u201cN,\u201d not \u201cM.\u201d \n\n[59] Now let us look at the crucial expression \u201cLA ELAAHA ELLA HOO\u201d \n\n(There is no god except He). This phrase occurs in the false injection 9:129. \n\nThis very special expression occurs 29 times in 19 suras (Table 38). By adding \nthe sura numbers of the 19 suras, plus the verse numbers where the phrase \u201cLAA \nELAAHA  ELLA  HOO\u201d  occurs,  plus  the  number  of  occurrences  of  this  crucial \nphrase, the grand total comes to 2128, or 19x112. This awesome result is depend-\nent on the fact that 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran. \n\nObviously, if 9:129 were included, the crucial expression \u201cLA ELAAHA ELLA \n\nHOO,\u201d the First Pillar of Islam, would not conform with the mathematical code. \n\n[60] The first occurrence of \u201cLA ELAAHA ELLA HOO\u201d is in 2:163, and the \nlast occurrence is in 73:9. If we add the sura number, plus the number of verses, \nplus  the  sum  of  verse  numbers  from  the  first  occurrence  to  the  last  occurrence, \nthe grand total comes to 316502, or 19x16658. \n\n\f"

            "1": "462 \n\nAppendix 24 \n\nThe Ultimate Quranic Miracle \n\n[62]  Brother  Abdullah  Arik  has  discovered  what  I  consider  to  be  the  ul-  \ntimate  Quranic  miracle.  This  miraculous  phenomenon  incontrovertibly  authenti-\ncates  every  single  verse  in  the  Quran\u2014the  number  of  verses  in  every  sura,  and   \nthe  numbers  assigned  to  every  single  verse  in  the  Quran\u2014while  exposing  and \nrejecting  the  false  injections,  9:128-129.  To  witness  this  great  phenomenon,  see \nPage 398. Putting the number of every verse in the Quran in sequence from the \nbeginning to the end, with the number of verses in each sura ahead of the verse \nnumbers of each sura, the final number consists of 12692 digits (19x668), and the \nnumber itself is also a multiple of 19. If the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 \nwas  used\u2014129  instead  of  127\u2014neither  the  number  of  digits,  nor  the  number \nitself would be divisible by 19. \n\n[63]  Since  the  subject  of  this  Appendix  is  Sura  9  and  its  number  of  true  \nverses, it is noteworthy that if we write down the number of the sura, 9, followed \nby the correct number of verses, 127, followed by the numbers of all the verses \nfrom 1 to 127, the resulting long number is a multiple of 19. Needless to say, if \nthe  wrong  number  of  verses  is  used,  i.e.,  129  instead  of  127,  this  remarkable \nmiracle would have disappeared: \n    9  127  1  2  3  4  5 ..... 122   123   124   125   126   127. \nThe  total  number  of  verses  in  Sura  9  is  followed  by  the  numbers  of  every    \nverse in the sura from 1 to 127. The resulting long number is a multiple of 19. \n\n[64]  The  number  of  verses  in  Sura  9,  127,  is  an  odd  number.  The  falsifiers \nadded two fake verses, and this made the number of verses 129, which is also an \nodd number. Mr. Arik used the same computer program he devised for Item 62 \nabove to check all odd-numbered verses in the Quran. Thus, the number of ver- \nses in every sura was written down, followed only by the last digit of each of the \nodd-numbered verses in that sura. Sura 1 was represented by the number 71357. \nSura 2 was represented by the number 28613579....5, and so on through the last \nsura.  The  result  is  a  long  number,  with  3371  digits,  that  is  divisble  by  19.  Ob- \nviously, Sura 9 was represented by the number 12713579...... 7: \n\n7 1 3 5 7  286 1 3 5 ... 3 5 ...... 5 1 3 5 6 1 3 5. \nThe  number  of  verses  in  every  sura  is  followed  by  the  last  digit  of  each  odd-\nnumbered verse. The resulting long number, 3371 digits, is a multiple of 19. \n\n[65] Since Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, Mr. Arik applied the same computer \nprogram to all 85 un-initialed suras. The number of every verse in each of the 85 \nsuras was written down, without the number of verses in the sura. Thus, Sura 1 \nwas  represented  by  the  number  1234567,  not  71234567.  This  was  done  with  all \nun-initialed suras. The final result is a number that consists of 6635 digits, and is \na multiple of 19. These awesome phenomena would be destroyed if we used the \nwrong number of verses for Sura 9, i.e., 129 instead of 127. \n\n\f"

The  item  presented  here  is  another  \none of those numerous proofs; it is chosen for its relevance to this Appendix. \n\nThe  gematrical  value  of  the  word  \u201cRashad,\u201d  as  written  in  the  Quran  (40:29, \n38) is 505 (R = 200, Sh = 300, A = 1, and D = 4). The gematrical value of the word \n\u201cKhalifa,\u201d as written in the Quran (38:26) is 725 (Kh = 600, L = 30, I = 10, F = 80, \nand  H  =  5).  By  writing  down  the  value  of  \u201cRashad,\u201d  followed  by  the  value  of \n\u201cKhalifa,\u201d followed by the number of Sura 9, followed by the correct number of \nverses in this sura, the product is 5057259127. This number is a multiple of 19; it \nequals 19 x 266171533. \n\n[67]  The  number  of  verses  from \n3:81,  where  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the \nCovenant  is  prophesied,  to  9:127,  the \nend of Sura 9, is 988 (19x52). Table 41. \n\n[68]  The  sum  of  verse  numbers \nfrom 3:81 to 9:127 is also a multiple of \n19 (Table 41). \n\n[69]  In  Verse  3:78,  just  3  verses \nbefore  proclaiming  God\u2019s  Messenger  \nof the Covenant, the word \u201cGod\u201d num-\nber  361  (19x19)  occurs.  This  verse \n(3:78)  informs  us  that  some  falsifiers \nwill  \u201cadd  falsehood  to  the  Quran,  then \nclaim  that  it  is  part  of  the  Quran;  they \nattribute lies to God, knowingly.\u201d \n\n[70]  The  word  \u201cGod\u201d  occurs  912 \ntimes  (19x48)  from  Verse  3:78,  which \nexposes the falsifiers, to 9:127. \n\n[71] The number of letters, plus the \nnumber  of  words  in  3:78  and  in  the \nfalse  verses  9:128-129,  give  the  same \ntotal,  143.

Vast  and  ut-      \n\nterly overwhelming as it is, it does not surpass or even match the overall mathe- \nmatical  miracle  of  the  Quran  which  is  detailed  in  Appendix  One.  This  merely \nconfirms  the  fact  that  the  Almighty  Author  of  the  Quran  has  deliberately  per-\nmitted the blasphemous addition of two verses to Sura 9 in order to: \n\n(1)  Demonstrate an essential function of the Quran\u2019s mathematical composi-\ntion. \n(2)  Prove the impossibility of tampering with the Quran. \n(3)  Fulfill  God\u2019s  promise  to  distinguish  the  believers  and  expose  the \nhypocrites. \n\n Why Did God Permit It For 1400 Years?? \nDue  to  the  mass  corruption  of  Islam  shortly  after  the  prophet  Muhammad\u2019s \ndeath, God obviously has fulfilled His pledge in 47:38. A divine decree issued in \nSura 47, which is entitled \u201cMuhammad,\u201d Verse 38 (19x2), stipulates that \u201cif the \nArabs  failed  to  uphold  the  Quran,  God  will  dismiss  them  from  His  grace,  and \nsubstitute other people in their place.\u201d \n\nWhen  the  Arabs  distorted  the  Quran  a  few  years  after  the  Prophet\u2019s  death,   \nand  exterminated  the  Prophet\u2019s  family  in  the  process,  they  incurred  God\u2019s    \npledge  of  47:38,  and  no  longer  deserved  to  possess  the  Quran;  the  true  Quran. \nThe evidence is irrefutable that the Arabs have abandoned the Quran en masse. \n\nFor  example,  there  is  not  a  single  mosque  in  the  so-called  Muslim  world  \ntoday  (1989)  that  upholds  the  crucial  commandment:  \u201cThe  mosques  belong  to \nGod; you shall not invoke anyone else besides God\u201d (72:18). \n\nThe call to prayer  (Azan) and  the prayer itself are  no longer  devoted to  God \n\nalone; Muhammad\u2019s name is invariably invoked along with the name of God. \n\nThe \u201cFirst Pillar of Islam\u201d is clearly stated in the Quran, 3:18 & 47:19, and its \nwords are decreed to be: LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH (There is no other god \nbesides  God).  But  the  Muslims,  as  early  as  the  first  century  AH,  do  not  want   \nGod  if  Muhammad  is  not  invoked  along  with  Him.  This  is  easily  demonstrable \ntoday by going into any mosque and declaring: \u201cLAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH;\u201d \nthis  will  actually  enrage  today\u2019s  Muslims.  This  behavior  is  documented  in  the \nQuran, 39:45. Moreover, my own research has now convinced me that the tradi-\ntional Muslims are forbidden by God from uttering the Quranic, divinely dic- \n\n \n\f"

Despite  the  Quran\u2019s \nrepeated assertions that it is \u201ccomplete, perfect, and fully detailed\u201d (6:19, 38, & \n114),  the  \u201cMuslims\u201d  have  refused  to  believe  their  Creator;  they  uphold  such \nridiculous and nonsensical  sources  as Hadith  and Sunna. This unanimous rebel-\nlion against God and His messenger, and the mass reversion to glaring idolatry\u2014 \nidolizing  the  Prophet  and  the  saints\u2014called  for  fulfillment  of  God\u2019s  pledge  in \n47:38. \n\nIn view of the incontrovertible divine evidence presented here, and in Appen-\n\ndices 1, 2, and 26, one can truly appreciate the following verses: \n\nSurely, we have revealed this message, \nand surely, we will preserve it. \n\n[ 15:9 ] \n\nSay, \u201cIf all the humans, and all the jinns, \nbanded together, in order to produce a Quran like this, \nthey will surely fail, no matter how much assistance \nthey lend one another.\u201d                                   [17:88 ] \n\nThe disbelievers rejected this message \nwhen it came to them, though it is a profound scripture. \nNo falsehood can enter it, \nthrough addition or deletion. \nFor it is a revelation from \nthe Most Wise, Most Praiseworthy. \n\n[ 41:41-42 ] \n\nIf we revealed this Quran to a mountain, \nyou would see it trembling, \ncrumbling, \nout of reverence for God. \n\n[ 59:21 ] \n\nI acknowledge with thanks the valuable contributions of Mahmoud Ali \nAbib, Gatut Adisoma, Abdullah Arik, Ihsan Ramadan, Lisa Spray, and \nEdip Yuksel.

We  learn  from  18:7-8  and  69:13-15 \nthat this  world will come to an end. A  new  earth and new heavens will replace   \nthe present heavens and earth (14:48). \n\nSigns of the Approaching End of the World \nThe  Quran  provides  many  signs,  and  states  that  the  means  for  unveiling  the \n\nend of the world have been given (47:18). The signs given in the Quran include: \n\n1.  The splitting of the moon: This already happened in June 1969 when we \nlanded  on  the  moon  and  brought  back  moon  rocks.  People  on  earth  can  go \nnow  to  many  museums,  colleges  and  observatories  to  look  at  pieces  of  the \nmoon. \n2.  Discovering the Quran\u2019s 19-based mathematical code (74:30-37): Fulfilled \nin 1969-1974. \n3.  The creature (27:82): \u201cMade from the earth, it alerts the people that they \nhave  been  oblivious  to  their  Creator.\u201d  The  Creature,  made  from  the  earth,    \ndid  appear  and  was  instrumental  in  unveiling  the  Quran\u2019s  numerical  code,   \nand proclaiming that the world has neglected God\u2019s  message; the creature is \nthe computer. Note that the digits that make up 27:82 add up to 19. \n4.  Appearance  of  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  (3:81):  As  detailed  in \nAppendix 2, a consolidating messenger, prophesied in the Quran, comes after \nall  the  prophets  have  delivered  the  scriptures,  to  purify  and  unify.  This \nprophecy was fulfilled in Ramadan 1408. \n5.  The  Smoke  (44:10):  occurs  after  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  has \ndelivered the unified message and proclaimed Islam (Submission) as the only \nreligion acceptable by God. \n6.  Gog  and  Magog:  they  re-appear,  in  accordance  with  God\u2019s  plan,  in  the  \nyear 1700 AH (2271 AD). Gog and Magog are mentioned in 18:94 and 21:96.        \nIf you count the verses from 18:94 to the end of Sura 18, you find them 17. If \nyou count the verses from 21:96 to the end of Sura 21, you find them also 17. \nThis is the Quran\u2019s sign that Gog and Magog will re-appear in 1700 AH. \n\nIt Will Not Remain Hidden [20:15] \n\nVerse 15 of Sura 20 informs us that the end of the world will be revealed by \nGod before the end of the world, and Sura 15, Verse 87, gives the time for that \nevent: \n\n \n\f"

The  total  gematrical  value  of   \nthese  profound  pillars  of  the  Quran\u2019s  miracle  pinpoints  the  year  of  the  end  of     \nthe world. It is noteworthy that Verse 85 of Sura 15 states: \u201cThe end of the world \nwill surely come to pass.\u201d The next verse, 15:86, tells us that God is the Creator \nof  this  world,  and,  of  course,  He  knows  when  it  will  end.  The  following  verse, \n15:87,  tells  us  when  the  world  will  end.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  gematrical \nvalues  of  \u201cThe  Seven  Pairs\u201d  of  Quranic  Initials  total  1709  (see  also  Table  1  of \nAppendix  1).  According  to  15:87,  the  world  will  survive  for  1709  lunar  years \nfrom  the  time  this  prophecy  is  stated  in  the  Quran.  This  means  that  the  world   \nwill end in the year 1710 AH. This number is a multiple of 19; 1710 = 19x90. \n\n  Table 1: Total Gematrical Value of \u201cThe Seven \n   Pairs\u201d of Quranic Initials. \n\nThe unveiling of this information took place in the year 1400 AH, 309 years \nbefore the prophesied end of the world (1709-1400 = 309). The number 309 is a \nQuranic  number  (18:25),  and  is \nconnected  with  the  end  of  the \nworld  (18:21).  The  peculiar  way  \nof  writing  309  in  18:25,  \u201cThree \nhundred \nnine,\u201d  indicates  that  the  309  are \nlunar  years.  The  difference  be-\ntween  300  solar  years  and  300 \nlunar years is 9 years. \nThe  year  of \n\nincreased \n\nyears, \n\nby   \n\nQuranic  \nInitial \n 1. Q \n 2. N \n 3. S (Saad)   \n 4.

Thus  the  world  ends  \nin  1710  AH,  19x90,  which  coin-\ncides  with  2280  AD,  19x120.  For \nthe  disbelievers  who  do  not  ac- \ncept \nthese  powerful  Quranic \nproofs,  the  end  of  the  world  will \ncome  suddenly  (6:31,  44,  47;  7:95, \n187;  12:107;  21:40,  22:55;  26:202; \n29:53; 39:55; 43:66; and 47:18). \n\nWhile Hadith is forbidden as a source of religious teachings (Appendix 19), it \ncan be a useful source of history. We can derive a lot of information about his-\ntorical  events  and  local  customs  and  traditions  during  the  early  centuries  of  \nIslam.  The  books  of  Hadith  indicate  that  the  Quranic  Initials  were  believed  to \ndetermine  the  life  span  of  the  Muslim  Ummah.  The  classic  exegesis  by  Al-\nBaydaawy  cites  the  following  historical  event  as  a  possible  explanation  of  the \nQuranic  Initials.

This is why we note that one of the most important \nand most repeated commandments in the Quran is: \n\nO you who believe, you shall remember God frequently; glorify Him day and \nnight. [33:41] \n\nTo  put  this  commandment  into  practice,  we  must  establish  certain  habits \nwhereby  we  guarantee  that  God  occupies  our  minds  more  than  anything  else.   \nThe Quran helps us establish such soul saving habits: \n\n1.

Salat  helps  us  remember  God  not  only  during  the  few  minutes  of  prayer,       \nbut  also  throughout  the  times  of  anticipation.  At  11:00  AM,  one  may  look  at  his       \nor  her  watch  to  see  if  the  noon  prayer  is  due  yet.  This  act  causes  one  to  think     \nabout God, and one is credited accordingly (20:14). \n\n2. Commemorate  God  before  eating:  Verse  6:121  enjoins  us  to  mention  God\u2019s   \nname  before  we  eat:  \u201cYou  shall  not  eat  from  that  upon  which  God\u2019s  name  has       \nnot been mentioned.\u201d \n\n3.

This  is  a  direct  commandment  that  we  must  carry  out,  no     \nmatter who we are talking with. \n\n4.

When  we  see  a  beautiful  \nflower,  or  animal,  or  sunsets,  we  must  glorify  God.  We  must  seize  every  pos-     \nsible opportunity to remember and glorify God, so that God may be our God. \n\n6. First  Utterance:  Make  it  a  habit  to  say:  \u201cIn  the  name  of  God,  Most  Gra-      \ncious,  Most  Merciful.  There  is  no  other  god  besides  God,\u201d  the  moment  you    \nwake  up  every  morning.

The latest claim came from Taha Hussein, the renowned Egyptian writer. \n\nThe  ignorant  Muslim  scholars  then  decided  to  proclaim  Muhammad  an  il-               \n\nliterate  man!  They  figured  that  this  would  make  the  Quran\u2019s  extraordinary      \nliterary  excellence  truly  miraculous.  The  word  they  relied  on  to  bestow  illiteracy     \nupon  the  Prophet  was  \u201cUMMY.\u201d  Unfortunately  for  those  \u201cscholars,\u201d  this  word    \nclearly  means  \u201cGentile,\u201d  or  one  who  does  not  follow  any  scripture  (Torah,  Injeel,         \nor Quran) [see 2:78, 3:20 & 75, 62:2]; it does NOT mean \u201cilliterate.\u201d \n\nThe Prophet was a successful merchant. The \u201cMuslim scholars\u201d who fabri- \ncated  the  illiteracy  lie  forgot  that  there  were  no  numbers  during  the  Prophet\u2019s       \ntime;  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  were  used  as  numbers.  As  a  merchant  dealing      \nwith  numbers  every  day,  the  Prophet  had  to  know  the  alphabet,  from  one  to              \none-thousand. \n\nThe  Quran  tells  us  that  Muhammad  wrote  down  the  Quran\u2014Muhammad\u2019s \ncontemporaries  are  quoted  as  saying,  \u201cThese  are  tales  from  the  past  that  he      \nwrote  down.  They  are  being  dictated  to  him  day  and  night\u201d  (25:5).  You  cannot \n\u201cdictate\u201d  to  an  illiterate  person.  The  Prophet\u2019s  enemies  who  accuse  him  of  il-    \nliteracy abuse Verse 29:48, which relates specifically to previous scriptures. \n\nOn  the  27th  night  of  Ramadan  13  B.H.  (Before  Hijerah),  Muhammad  the     \nsoul,  the  real  person,  not  the  body,  was  summoned  to  the  highest  universe  and       \nthe  Quran  was  given  to  him  (2:97,  17:1,  44:3,  53:1-18,  97:1-5).  Subsequently,  the \nangel  Gabriel  helped  Muhammad  release  a  few  verses  of  the  Quran  at  a  time,       \nfrom  the  soul  to  Muhammad\u2019s  memory.  The  Prophet  wrote  down  and  memo-      \nrized  the  verses  just  released  into  his  mind.  When  the  Prophet  died,  he  left  the \ncomplete  Quran  written  down  with  his  own  hand  in  the  chronological  order  of \nrevelation,  along  with  specific  instructions  as  to  where  to  place  every  verse.  The \ndivine  instructions  recorded  by  the  Prophet  were  designed  to  put  the  Quran    \ntogether  into  the  final  format  intended  for  God\u2019s  Final  Testament  to  the  world    \n(75:17).

Many  theories  have  been  advanced  to    \nexplain this phenomenon. \n\nNow  we  learn  that  the  missing  Basmalah  plays  a  significant  role  as  [1]  a  sig-\nnificant  constituent  of  the  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  miracle,  and  [2]  a  glaring  sign       \nfrom  the  Most  Gracious,  Most  Merciful,  that  Sura  9  has  been  tampered  with  and      \nmust be purified (Appendix 24).

Any abuse of this divine permission incurs severe retribution. Thus, although \npolygamy  is  permitted  by  God,  it  behooves  us  to  examine  our  circumstances \ncarefully before saying that a particular polygamous relationship is permissible. \n\nOur perfect example here is the prophet Muhammad. He was  married to one \nwife,  Khadijah,  until  she  died.  He  had  all  his  children,  except  one,  from  Khadi-\njah. Thus, she and her children enjoyed the Prophet\u2019s full attention for as long as \nshe  was  married  to  him;  twenty-five  years.  For  all  practical  purposes,  Muham-\nmad had one wife\u2014from the age of 25 to 50. During the remaining 13 years of  \nhis life, he  married the aged widows of his friends who left  many  children. The \nchildren  needed  a  complete  home,  with  a  fatherly  figure,  and  the  Prophet  \nprovided  that.  Providing  a  fatherly  figure  for  orphans  is  the  only  specific  cir-\ncumstance in support of polygamy mentioned in the Quran (4:3). \n\nOther  than  marrying  widowed  mothers  of  orphans,  there  were  three  political \nmarriages  in  the  Prophet\u2019s  life.  His  close  friends  Abu  Bakr  and  Omar  insisted   \nthat  he  marry  their  daughters,  Aisha  and  Hafsah,  to  establish  traditional  family \nties  among  them.  The  third  marriage  was  to  Maria  the  Egyptian;  she  was  given   \nto him as a political gesture of friendship from the ruler of Egypt. \n\nThis perfect example tells us that a man must give his full attention and loyal-\nty in marriage to his wife and children in order to raise a happy and wholesome \nfamily. \n\n\f"

Therefore,  unless  we  are  absolutely  sure  that  God\u2019s  law  will  not  be   \nabused,  we  had  better  resist  our  lust  and  stay  away  from  polygamy.  If  the  cir-                  \ncumstances  do  not  dictate  polygamy,  we  had  better  give  our  full  attention  to  one     \nwife  and  one  set  of  children.  The  children\u2019s  psychological  and  social  well-being, \nespecially  in  countries  where  polygamy  is  prohibited,  almost  invariably  dictate \nmonogamy. A few basic criteria must be observed in contemplating polygamy: \n1. It must alleviate pain and suffering and not cause any pain or suffering. \n2. If you have a young family, it is almost certain that polygamy is an abuse. \n3. Polygamy to substitute a younger wife is an abuse of God\u2019s law (4:19). \n\n*********************** \n\nAppendix 31 \nEvolution: Divinely Controlled \nWe learn from the Quran that evolution is a divinely designed fact: \nLife began in water: \n\n\u201cFrom water we initiated all living things.\u201d \n\n(21:30, 24:45) \n\nHumans not descendants of monkeys: \u201cHe started the creation of man from \n\nmud.\u201d (32:7) \n\nMan created from \u201caged\u201d mud:  \u201cI am creating the human being from \n\n\u2018aged\u2019 clay.\u201d (15:28) \n\nEvolution  is  possible  only  within  a  given  species.  For  example,  the  navel \norange  evolved  from  seeded  oranges,  not  from  apples.  The  laws  of  probablity   \npreclude  the  possibility  of  haphazard  evolution  between  species.  A  fish  cannot   \nevolve into a bird; a monkey can never evolve into a human. \n\nProbability Laws Preclude Darwin\u2019s Evolution \nIn  this  computer  age,  we  have  mathematical  laws  that  tell  us  whether  a  cer-      \ntain  event  is  probable  or  not.  If  we  throw  five  numbered  cubes  up  in  the  air  and         \nlet  them  fall  into  a  guided  straight  line,  the  probability  laws  tell  us  the  number  of \npossible  combinations  we  can  get:  1x2x3x4x5  =  120  combinations.  Thus,  the  prob-\nability  of  obtaining  any  combination  is  1  in  120,  or  1/120,  or  0.0086.  This  prob-  \nability  diminishes  fast  when  we  increase  the  number  of  cubes.  If  we  increase    \nthem  by  one,  the  number  of  combinations  becomes  1x2x3x4x5x6  =  720,  and  the \nprobability  of  getting  any  combination  diminishes  to  1/720,  0.0014.  Mathe-\nmaticians,  who  are  very  exacting  scientists,  have  agreed  that  the  probability \ndiminishes to \u201cZero\u201d when we increase the number of cubes to 84.

The  human  gene  contains  30,000,000,000  nucleotides;  1%  of  that  is \n300,000,000. \n\nA fitting quote here is that of Professor Edwin Conklin; he stated: \n\nThe probability of life originating from accident is comparable to the prob-\nability of the Unabridged Dictionary resulting from an explosion in a print-\ning factory. \n\n*********************** \nAppendix 32 \nThe Crucial Age of 40 \nWhat is the age of responsibility? If a child dies at the age of 12, without even \nhearing about God, does this child go to Heaven or Hell? What if the child is 15 \nyears old, or 21, or 25? At what age will the human being be held responsible for \nhis  or  her  beliefs?  This  question  has  puzzled  researchers  of  all  religions  for  a  \nlong time. \n\nThe  Quran  sets  the  age  of  responsibility  at  40;  anyone  who  dies  before  this  \nage  goes  to  Heaven  (46:15).  If  the  person  believed  in  God  and  benefitted  from \nbelief by nourishing and developing the soul (see Appendix 15), he or she goes  \nto the High Heaven. Otherwise, the person goes to the Lower Heaven. \n\nYour first reaction to this piece of information is objection: \u201cWhat if the per-\nson  was  really  bad,  evil,  and  an  atheist,  will  he  go  to  Heaven  if  he  died  before   \nthe age of 40?\u201d This is because you are mean, while God is the Most Merciful. \nOur tendency is to \u201cput them all in Hell.\u201d \n\nPeople who object strongly to this Divine mercy cannot come up with a cut- \noff age of responsibility. They ask questions like, \u201cWhat if the person was really \nwicked?\u201d The answer is, \u201cDoes God know that this person was wicked?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cDoes  God  know  that  this  person  does  not  deserve  to  go  to  Heaven?\u201d  \u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cTherefore, this person will not die before the age of 40.\u201d As simple as that.

He  knows  exactly  who \ndeserves to go Heaven and who deserves to go to Hell. \n\nEarly  in  1989  a  man  by  the  name  of  Theodore  Robert  Bundy  was  executed   \nfor killing a number of women. The whole nation agreed that he was one of the \nmost vicious criminals in history. So much so that his execution was one of the \nrare  occasions  where  the  opponents  of  capital  punishment  did  not  protest.  On    \nthe  contrary,  many  people  actually  celebrated  his  execution.  Numerous  jour-\nnalists, editorials, and politicians lamented the fact that justice took eleven years \nto execute Ted Bundy. They stated that Bundy should have been executed within \na maximum of six years after his conviction. According to the Quran, this would \nhave been the greatest favor anyone could have done to Bundy. He was 42 years \nold when executed. Had he been executed five years earlier, at the age of 37, he \nwould have gone straight to Heaven, and he did not deserve that. \n\nAs it turns out, Bundy was one of the signs God has given us to confirm that \nanyone  who  dies  before  40  goes  to  Heaven.  Bundy\u2019s  name,  Theodore  Robert \nBundy, consists of 19 letters, and he confessed to killing 19 women just one day \nbefore his execution. There were many other signs from God. \n\nDelivering  this  important  piece  of  information  is  one  of  the  responsibilities \n\ngiven to me as God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant. It is not my personal opinion. \n\nIt  is  noteworthy  that  both  Martin  Luther  King  and  Malcolm  X  were  assas-\n\nsinated just a couple of months before their 40th birthdays. \n\n*********************** \n\nAppendix 33 \nWhy Did God Send A Messenger Now? \nAs  stated  in  3:81,  and  in  Appendix  2,  God  has  sent  a  messenger  to  con-           \n\nsolidate the messages delivered by all the prophets, purify them, and unify them \ninto one religion: Submission. The timing is certainly ripe for fulfillment of this \nimportant prophecy, for the following reasons: \n\n1. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have been corrupted beyond recognition. \n2. All God\u2019s messages have been delivered; the Quran is the Final Testament. \n3. More than 93% of the human  beings destined to live in this world are  yet   \nto come. As illustrated in the Introduction, Page xiv, the people who have lived \non  this  earth  since  Adam  are  only  one-fifteenth  of  the  total  projected  human \npopulation. \n\nJudaism \n\nThe  best illustration  of today\u2019s  corrupted  Judaism  can  be  found  in  the books   \nof  a  famous  Rabbi;  Harold  S.  Kushner.  In  his  best  seller  WHEN  BAD  THINGS \nHAPPEN  TO  GOOD  PEOPLE,  Avon  Books,  1981,  Rabbi  Kushner  states  the \nfollowing: \n\n\f"

This  means  that  they  must  keep  themselves  for  their  spouses \nonly,  and  never  allow  anyone  else  to  touch  them  in  a  sexual  manner \n(23:5-6, 24:30, 33:35, 70:29-30). \n\nToday\u2019s  society  is  replete  with  powerful  temptations.  In  America\u2019s  society  of      \n\nthe  eighties,  even  parents  start  talking  about  boyfriends  for  their  daughters  and \ngirlfriends  for  their  sons.  When  they  reach  their  teens,  many  parents  even  supply     \nbirth  control  means  to  their  children.  An  alarming  percentage  of  teen-agers  are \nsexually  active,  even  though  they  are  not  physiologically  mature,  and  without  any   \nmoral  limitations.  Millions  of  illicit  pregnancies  and  the  tragedies  associated  with  \nthem, plus millions of tragic abortions, happen every month in the USA. \n\nAmong  the  results  of  this  moral  breakdown:  unwanted  and  unsupported   \nchildren,  delinquent  and  irresponsible  fathers,  criminals  who  have  no  regard  for \npeople\u2019s  lives  or  properties,  millions  of  social  misfits,  incurable  genital  herpes, \nincurable  genital  warts,  devastating  syphilis  and  gonorrhea,  dysplasia,  the  killer    \nAIDS, and new diseases never known before. \n\nWhat  most  people  do  not  know  is  that  this  moral  breakdown  costs  them   \ndearly  throughout  their  lives.  For  the  only  law  that  rules  the  world  is  God\u2019s  law,        \nand  these  flagrant  violations  of  God\u2019s  law  cost  them  a  lot  of  misery  and  problems \n(20:124). \n\nThe  true  believers  who  care  about  their  children  will  advise  them  and  remind    \nthem  repeatedly  and  persistently  (20:132)  to  keep  their  chastity.  This  means  stay-        \ning  a  virgin  until  their  wedding  night,  then  staying  loyal  to  one\u2019s  spouse\u2014never \ncommitting  adultery\u2014for  their  own  happiness.  God\u2019s  advice  to  keep  our  chastity, \nbefore  and  after  marriage,  is  for  our  own  good.  God  is  the  one  who  controls  our \nhealth, wealth, and happiness or misery (53:43, 48). \n\n************************** \nAppendix 35 \nDrugs & Alcohol \nThere  is  no  compromise  whatsoever  regarding  illicit  drugs  and  alcoholic \nbeverages;  they  are  called  \u201cabominations  and  the  work  of  Satan\u201d  (5:90).

Had  they  observed  the  Torah,  the  Gospel,  and  what  is \nrevealed  herein  from  their  Lord,  they  would  have  enjoyed  provisions  from \nabove  them,  and  from  beneath  their  feet.  Some  of  them  are  righteous,  but \nmost of them are evil doers. \n\n[5:65-66] \n\nIf  only  the  people  of  the  various  communities  believed  and  maintained  a \nrighteous  life,  we  would  have  showered  them  with  blessings  from  the  heaven \nand the earth. \n\n[7:96] \n\nGod is the One who controls your happiness, or misery. \n.... God is the One who makes you rich or poor. \n\n[53:43, 48] \n\nA  nation  that  upholds  God\u2019s  laws  is  guaranteed  prominence  among  the  na-\ntions  of  the  world,  victory,  prosperity,  and  happiness  (10:62-64,  16:97,  24:55, \n41:30-31).  On  the  other  hand,  a  nation  that  violates  God\u2019s  laws  incurs  a  mis-\nerable life (20:124). A nation that upholds God\u2019s laws is guaranteed to be a great \nnation.  This  is  not a  mere  idealistic dream;  since God is in  full  control (10:61), \nHis  guarantees  and  promises  are  done.  A  nation  that  upholds  God\u2019s  laws  is \ncharacterized by: \n\n1.  Maximum  freedom  for  the  people\u2014freedom  of  religion,  freedom  of  ex-\n\npression, freedom to travel, and freedom of economy (2:256, 10:99, 88:21-22). \n\n2. Guaranteed human rights for all the people, regardless of their race, color, \n\ncreed, social status, financial situation, or political affiliation (5:8, 49:13). \n\n3. Prosperity for all the people. God\u2019s economic system is based on constant \ncirculation  of  wealth,  no  usury,  and  productive  investment.  Non-productive \neconomy  such  as  gambling,  lottery,  and  high  interest  loans  are  not  permitted \n(2:275-7, 59:7). \n\n4. Social justice for all. Because of the obligatory charity (Zakat), no one will \n\ngo hungry or un-sheltered (2:215, 70:24-25, 107:1-7). \n\n5. A political system that is based on unanimous consensus. Through mutual \nconsultation and freedom of expression, one side of any given issue convinces all \nparticipants in the discussion. The end result is a unanimous agreement, not the \nopinion of a 51% majority rammed down the throat of the 49% minority (42:38). \n6. A  society  that  upholds  and  maintains  the  highest  standards  of  moral  be-\nhavior.  There  will  be  a  strong  family,  no  alcoholism,  no  illicit  drugs,  no  il-\nlegitimate pregnancies, no abortions, and practically no divorce. \n\n7.

Environmental  protection  is  guaranteed  through  conservation  and  prohibi-\n\ntion of wasteful practices (30:41). \n\n************************** \nAppendix 37 \nCriminal Justice \nIf a thief steals a thousand dollars from you, and they put him in prison, what \ndo you get? If the thief has a wife and children, what is their crime? Why should \nthey be deprived of their father? \n\nThe  Quran  solves  this  problem,  as  well  as  the  problems  associated  with  the \n\ncriminal justice systems prevalent in today\u2019s world. \n\nEquivalence is the Law [2:178-179] \nAccording to the Quranic criminal justice, the thief who is convicted of steal-\ning  a  thousand  dollars  from  you  must  work  for  you  until  you  are  fully  paid  for  \nthe thousand dollars you lost, plus any other damage and inconvenience the theft \nmay  have  caused  you.  At  the  same  time,  the  thief\u2019s  innocent  wife  and  children   \nare  not  deprived  of  their  man,  and  the  expensive  prison  system  is  eliminated. \nImprisonment is a cruel and inhumane punishment that has proven useless to all \nconcerned. \n\nContrary to common belief, the thief\u2019s hand shall not be cut off. Thank God \nfor His mercy and His mathematical miracle in the Quran, we know now that the \nthief\u2019s hand is to be marked. Marking the hand of the thief is stated in 5:38. The \nsura  and  verse  numbers  add  up  to  5  +  38  =  43.  The  other  place  in  the  Quran  \nwhere \u201cthe hand is cut\u201d is found in 12:31. This is where we see the women who \nadmired  Joseph  so  much,  they  \u201ccut\u201d  their  hands.  Obviously,  they  did  not  sever \ntheir  hands;  no  one  can  do  that.  The  sura  and  verse  numbers  add  up  to                \n12 + 31 = 43, the same total as in 5:38. This gives mathematical confirmation that \nthe Quranic law calls for marking the hand of the thief, not severing it. Addition-\nal mathematical confirmation is provided: 19 verses after 12:31, we see the \u201ccut-\nting  of  the  hand\u201d  again.  Punishment  in  Islam  (Submission)  is  based  on \nequivalence and social pressure (2:178, 5:38, 24:2). \n\nThe  blasphemy  called  \u201cHadith  &  Sunna\u201d  has  instituted  stoning  to  death  as   \nthe punishment for married adulterers. This is not God\u2019s law. As stated in 24:2, \nthe punishment for adultery is whipping in public; a hundred symbolic lashes. As \npointed  out  above,  the  basic  punishment  is  social  pressure  and  scandalizing  the \ncriminal. Whipping in public achieves this goal. \n\nIn  dealing  with  murder,  the  Quran  definitely  discourages  capital  punishment \n(2:179).  \u201cThe  free  for  the  free,  the  slave  for  the  slave,  and  the  female  for  the \nfemale\u201d (2:178). Due to human meanness and injustice, many people cannot even \nimagine  what  this  Quranic  law  says.  They  refuse  to  accept  the  clear  injunc-    \ntions that strict equivalence must be observed\u2014if a woman kills a man, or a man \n\n\f"
