The number in the right hand corner is the  cumulative  total  of  the  numbers  for  verses  containing  the  word  “God.”  The last  page  of  the  text,  Page  372,  shows  that  the  total  occurrence  of  the  word “God” is 2698, or 19x142. The total sum of verse numbers for all verses containing the word “God” is 118123, also a multiple of 19 (118123 = 19x6217).",

No  human  being(s)  could  have  kept  track  of  2698 occurrences  of  the  word  “God,”  and  the  numbers  of  verses  where  they  occur. This is especially impossible in view of (1) the age of ignorance during which the Quran  was  revealed,  and  (2)  the  fact  that  the  suras  and  verses  were  widely separated  in  time  and  place  of  revelation.  The  chronological  order  of  revelation was  vastly  different  from  the  final  format  (Appendix  23).  However,  the  Quran’s mathematical  system  is  not  limited  to  the  word  “God;”  it  is  extremely  vast,  extremely intricate, and totally comprehensive. "

For example, it was observed that the people who disbelieved in Lot are mentioned in 50:13 and occur in the Quran 13 times—7:80; 11:70, 11:74, 11:89; 21:74; 22:43; 26:160; 27:54, 27:56; 29:28; 38:13; 50:13; and 54:33. Consistently, they are referred to as “Qawm,” with the single exception of the Q-initialed Sura 50 where they are referred to as “Ikhwaan.” Obviously, if the regular, Q-containing word “Qawm” were used, the count of the letter “Q” in Sura 50 would have become 58, and this whole phenomenon would have disappeared.

Thus, the total occurrence of the three letters in the six suras is 19874 (19x 1046), and the alteration of one of these letters destroys this phenomenon.",
            "4": "These initials are found in Suras 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15. The total occurrences of these letters in these suras are 2489 (19x131), 2489 (19x131), 2375 (19x 125), 1197 (19x63), and 912 (19x48), respectively (Table 5).",

Thus, the total occurrence of the four letters in this sura is 2529 + 1530 + 1164 + 97 = 5320 = 19x280.",
            "9": "An important observation here is the interlocking relationship involving the letter “S” (Saad). This initial occurs also in Suras 19 and 38. While complementing its sister letters in Sura 7 to give a total that is divisible by 19, the frequency of this letter also complements its sister letters in Suras 19 and 38 to give a multiple of 19 (see Page 380).",
            "10": "Additionally, the Quranic Initial “S” (Saad) interacts with the Quranic Initials “K.H.Y. ‘A.” (Kaaf Haa Ya ‘Ayn) in Sura 19 to give another total that is also a multiple of 19 (see Page 383). This interlocking relationship—which is not unique to the initial “S” (Saad)—contributes to the intricacy of the Quran’s numerical code."

It is all gross falsehood, because there are only nineteen times that the Holy Name is mentioned [in that portion of the morning prayer]... and similarly you find the word ’Elohim nineteen times in the pericope of Ve-’elleh shemot. . . . Similarly, you find that Israel were called “sons” nineteen times, and there are many other examples. All these sets of nineteen are intricately intertwined, and they contain many secrets and esoteric meanings, which are contained in more than eight large volumes...

The simultaneous control of the literary style and the intricate mathematical distribution of individual letters throughout the Quran (Appendix 1) is evident in the fact that the Quran is made easy to memorize, understand, and enjoy. Unlike a human-made book, the Quran is enjoyable to read over and over, infinitely.",
            "5": "The title of this Appendix is repeated in Sura 54, verses 17, 22, 32, and 40. As it turns out, the Quran’s Arabic text is composed in such a way as to remind the reader or the memorizer of the next correct expression, or the next verse. God created us and He knows the most efficient way for fixing literary materials into our memory. Memorization of the Quran has played a vital role in preserving the original text generation after generation at a time when written books were a rarity.",
            "6": "Without even realizing it, the person who memorizes the Quran is divinely helped by an intricate literary system as he utters the sounds of the Quranic words. Almost every verse in the Quran contains what I call “Memory Bells.” Their function is to remind the reader of what comes next. This system is so vast, I will give only two illustrative examples:",
            "7": "1. In Sura 2, Verses 127, 128, and 129 end with two different names of God each. These pairs of names are “Al-Samee‘Al-‘Aleem (The Hearer, the Omniscient),” “Al-Tawwaab Al-Raheem (The Redeemer, Most Merciful)”, and “Al-‘Azeez Al-Hakeem (The Almighty, Most Wise),” respectively. If this were a regular book, one would easily mis-match these six names. Not so in the Quran. Each one of these pairs is preceded in the same verse by a “Memory Bell” that reminds us of the correct pair of names. Thus, Verse 127 talks about Abraham and Ismail raising the foundations of the Ka‘abah. The verse ends with the names “Al-Samee‘ Al-‘Aleem.” The prominent sounds here are the “S,” “M,” and “ ‘Ayn.” These three letters are prominent in the word “Ismail.” We find that this word is conspicuously delayed in the sentence, while improving its literary quality. Thus, we find that the verse goes like this: “When Abraham raised the foundations of the Ka‘abah, together with Ismail ...” Normally, a human writer would say, “When Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the Ka‘abah...” But delaying the sounds in “Ismail” brings them closer to the end of the verse, and thus reminds us that the correct names of God in this verse are “Al-Samee‘ Al-‘Aleem.”",
            "8": "Verse 128 has the prominent word “Tubb” just before the names “Al-Tawwaab Al-Raheem.” The word “Tubb” thus serves as the memory bell. The names of God at the end of 2:129 are “Azeez, Hakeem.” The prominent sounds here are “Z” and “K.” Obviously, the memory bell in this verse is the word “Yuzakkeehim”"

Another good example is found in 3:176, 3:177, & 3:178, where the retribution for disbelievers is described as “ ‘Azeem (Terrible),” Aleem (Painful),” and “Muheen (Humiliating),” respectively. In a human-made book, the memorizer could easily mix up these three descriptions. But we find that each of these adjectives is preceded by powerful memory bells that prevent such a mix-up. The word “ ‘Azeem” of Verse 176 is preceded by the word “Huzzun” which is characterized by a stressed letter “Z.” This serves to remind us of the particular adjective at the end of this verse. The word “Aleem” of Verse 177 is preceded by the sound of the word “Iman” to serve as a memory bell, and the word “Muheen” of 3:178 is preceded by an abundance of “M” and “H” throughout this verse.",
            "2": "Other examples of memory bells include the ending of 3:173 and the beginning of 3:174, the ending of 4:52 and the beginning of 4:53, the ending of 4:61 and the beginning of 4:62, the ending of 18:53 and the beginning of 18:54, and many more.",
            "5": "We learn from 41:44 that the sincere believers have access to the Quran, regardless of their mother tongue. The disbelievers, on the other hand, are not permitted access to the Quran, even if they are professors of the Arabic language (17:45, 18:57, 41:44, & 56:79).",
            "6": "Arabic is the most efficient language in the world, especially when it comes to the precise statement of laws. Since the Quran is a Statute Book, it was crucial that such laws must be clearly stated. God chose Arabic for His Final Testament because of the obvious reason that it is the most suitable language for that purpose. Arabic is unique in its efficiency and accuracy. For example, the word “they” in English does not tell you if “they” are males or females. In Arabic there is a “they” for the males, “HUM,” and a “they” for the females, “HUNNA.” There is even a “they” for two males, “HUMAA,” and a “they” for two females, “HAATAAN.” This feature does not exist in any other language in the world. I came to appreciate this efficiency of the Arabic language when I translated, for example, 2:228. This verse enjoins the divorcee to give up her own wishes to divorce her husband, if she discovers that she is pregnant, and the husband wishes to reconcile—the welfare of the child takes a priority. The efficiency of the Arabic language was extremely helpful in stating this law. Any other language would have made it almost impossible to point out whose wishes are to be superseded, at least not in such a few words as we see in 2:228.",
            "7": "The word “Qaalataa” of 28:23, for example, translates into four English words: “the two women said.” Such is the efficiency of the Arabic language.",
            "8": "Another possible reason for choosing Arabic is the fact that “He” and “She” do not necessarily imply natural gender. Thus, when God is referred to as “He,” this does not imply gender at all. God be glorified; He is neither male, nor female. The usage of “He” to refer to God in the English language, for example, has contributed to a false image of God. This was not helped by such distorted expressions as “Father” when referring to God. You never find such a reference to God in the Quran."

Thus, they start over without any biases, and exercise full freedom to uphold God’s absolute authority or Satan’s polytheistic theory. To make this crucial decision, every human being receives a message from God advocating His absolute authority, as well as a message from Satan pushing his polytheistic principles.",
            "2": "To give us a headstart, the Most Merciful gathered all the human beings before Him, prior to sending us to this world, and we bore witness that He alone is our Lord and Master (7:172). Thus, upholding God’s absolute authority is a natural instinct that is an integral part of every human being.",
            "3": "After putting the rebels to death, the souls of humans and jinns were placed in a special depository. God then created the appropriate bodies to house the souls of jinns and humans during the test period. The first jinn body was made from fire, and Satan was assigned to that body (15:27). The first human body was created from earthly material, clay (15:26), and God assigned the first human soul to that body. The divine plan called for the angels to serve the humans on earth—guard them, drive the wind and rain for them, distribute provisions, etc. This fact is stated in the Quran allegorically: “Your Lord said to the angels, ‘Fall prostrate before Adam.’ ” Satan of course refused to have anything to do with serving the human race (2:34, 7:11, 17:61, 18:50, 20:116).",
            "4": "While Adam’s body remained on earth, the real person, the soul, was admitted into Heaven in the outermost universe. God gave Adam certain commandments, represented by the forbidden tree, and Satan was appointed as Adam’s companion to deliver to Adam his satanic message. The rest is history.",
            "5": "Every time a human being is born, a human person is assigned to the new baby from the depository of souls. God assigns the souls in accordance with His knowledge (28:68). Every soul deserves to be assigned to a certain body, and live under certain circumstances. God alone knows which souls are good and which souls are evil. Our children are assigned to our homes in accordance with God’s plan.",

While the physical body of any jinn is reproduced from the parent jinns, the jinn soul is that of an independent individual. Jinns are descendants of Satan (7:27, 18:50). The assigned jinn remains with the human being from birth to death, and serves as the main witness on the Day of Judgment (50:23). A continuous debate takes place in our heads between the human soul and the jinn soul until both of them are convinced of one point of view."

The original sin was our failure to uphold God’s absolute authority during the Great Feud. If the human person convinces his or her jinn companion to denounce that original sin, and uphold God’s absolute authority, both creatures are redeemed to God’s eternal kingdom on the Day of Judgment. But if the jinn companion convinces the human being to uphold Satan’s idolatrous views, then both creatures are exiled forever from God’s kingdom.",

The world is divinely designed to manifest our decision to uphold either God’s absolute authority, or Satan’s idolatrous views (67:1-2). The day and the night change constantly to test our willingness to uphold God’s laws by observing the Dawn Prayer and fasting during the hottest and longest days. Only those who are totally certain about God’s absolute authority are redeemed (26:89).",

They imagine Muhammad on the Day of Judgment choosing the candidates for his intercession. If you ask those who believe in intercession: “How will Muhammad recognize those who deserve his intercession?” they tell you, “God will tell him!” According to this concept, a person will go to Muhammad and request his intercession. Muhammad will then ask God whether this person deserves his intercession or not. God will inform Muhammad that the person deserves to go to Paradise. Muhammad will then turn around and tell God that the person deserves to go to Paradise! The blasphemy is obvious; those who believe in intercession make God a secretary of their idol Muhammad. God be glorified.",
            "2": "Since the Quran is the most accurate book, it acknowledges that everyone in Paradise will intercede on behalf of his or her loved ones: “Please God, admit my mother into Paradise.” This intercession will work if the person’s mother deserves to go to Paradise (2:255, 20:109, 21:28). Thus, intercession, though it will take place in this manner, is utterly useless.",

Muhammad could not intercede on behalf of his uncle (111:1-3) or relatives (9:80). What makes anyone think that a prophet or a saint will intercede on behalf of a perfect stranger?!

            "6": "One of the prevalent myths is that Muhammad was the founder of Islam. Although Islam, total submission to God alone, is the only religion recognized by God since the time of Adam (3:19, 3:85), Abraham is reported in the Quran as the first user of the word “Islam” (Submission) and the one who called us “Muslims”, i.e., Submitters (22:78). Abraham’s exemplary submission to God is demonstrated by his famous willingness to sacrifice his only son, Ismail, when he thought that that was God’s command. As it turns out, such a command was in fact from Satan.",
            "8": "God is the Most Merciful. He never violates His own law (7:28). Any person who believes that the Most Merciful ordered Abraham to kill his son cannot possibly make it to God’s Heaven. Such evil thought about God is grossly blasphemous. Nowhere in the Quran do we see that God ordered Abraham to kill his son. On the contrary, God intervened to save Abraham and Ismail from Satan’s plot (37:107), and He told Abraham: “You believed the dream” (37:105). Undoubtedly, it was a dream inspired by Satan. God’s irrevocable law is: “God never advocates sin” (7:28)."

Verse 16:123 is direct proof that all religious practices in Islam were intact when Muhammad was born. Muhammad was enjoined to “follow the religion of Abraham.” If I ask you to buy a color TV, it is assumed that you know what a color TV is. Similarly, when God enjoined Muhammad to follow the practices of Abraham (16:123), such practices must have been well known.",

There is no dispute concerning the number of Rak‘ahs in all five daily prayers. This proves the divine preservation of Salat. The Quran’s mathematical code confirms the number of Rak‘ahs in the five prayers 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. The number 24434 is a multiple of 19.",
            "4": "The Quran deals only with practices that were distorted. For example, the distorted ablution is restored in 5:6 to its original four steps. The tone of voice during the contact prayers (Salat) was distorted—many Muslims pray silently. This was corrected in the Quran, 17:110. The fasting during Ramadan was modified in the Quran to allow intercourse during the night (2:187). Zakat is restored in 6:141, and Hajj is restored to the four correct months (see Appendix 15).",

One example of God’s guidance for those who deserve guidance is found in 21:51: “We granted Abraham his guidance, for we were fully aware of him.” In other words, God knew that Abraham was a good soul who deserved to be guided, and God granted him his guidance and understanding. Another good example is stated in 12:24. Joseph fell for the Egyptian nobleman’s wife, and almost committed adultery “if it were not that he saw a sign from his Lord.” God teaches us in 12:24 that He “diverted evil and sin from Joseph, for he was one of My devoted worshipers.” Was it Joseph who controlled his lust?

From Muzdalifah, the pilgrim goes to Mina to spend two or three days (2:203). On the first morning at Mina, the pilgrim offers an animal sacrifice to feed the poor and to commemorate God’s intervention to save Ismail and Abraham from Satan’s trick (37:107, Appendix 9).

In a glaring act of idolatry, the Muslims have set up Muhammad’s tomb as another “Sacred Mosque”! This is a blasphemous violation of the Quran, and, ironically, even violates Hadith.

These two verses inform us that “the meat” of pigs is prohibited, not “the fat.” Obviously, God knew that in many countries, lard would be used in baked goods and other food products, and that such usage does not render the foods Haraam (prohibited).

However, the Quran is full of information that is kept by Almighty God for revelation at a specific time. Now is the time to look at the verses shown above and learn the great news: THE RIGHTEOUS DO NOT DIE; when their lives on this earth come to the predetermined end, the angel of death simply invites them to leave their earthly bodies and move on to Heaven, the same Paradise where Adam and Eve once lived.

The Quran teaches that the disbelievers go through 2 deaths (2:28 & 40:11). They will be put to death — a state of nothingness during which they see Hell day and night in a continuous nightmare that lasts until the Day of Judgment (40:46). Hell is not yet in existence (40:46, 89:23).",

In 36:26-27, we see the best evidence that the righteous go to Paradise, while their friends and relatives are still living on earth. Like going to Hawaii and waiting for us there.

When we add the number of verses in each sura, plus the sum of verse numbers (1 + 2 + 3 +... + n, where n = number of verses), plus the number of each sura, the cumulative total for the whole Quran comes to 346199, or 19x19x959. This phenomenon confirms the authenticity of every verse in the Quran, while excluding 9:128-129. Table 3 is an abbreviated illustration of the calculations of Item 13. This phenomenon is impossible if the false Verses 9:128-129 are included.",

The cumulative total for all un-initialed suras is 156066, or 19x8214. This result depends on the fact that Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, not 129. The data are shown in Table 4.

Let us look at all the verses whose digits add up  to  10,  from  the  missing  Basmalah  of Sura 9, to the extra Basmalah  of Sura 27. If  Sura  9  consisted  of  129  verses,  the grand total would be 2472, instead of 2470 (19x130);  2472  is  not  a  multiple  of  19,  and this  phenomenon  would  have  disappeared.

The  number 129 ends  with the digit “9.” Let us  look at  the  first  sura  and  the  last  sura  whose number  of  verses  ends  with  the  digit  “9.” These  are  Sura  10  and  Sura  104.  By  adding the  sura  number,  plus  the  number  of  verses, plus  the  sum  of  verse  numbers,  from  Sura  10 to  Sura  104,  we  get  a  grand  total  that  equals 23655,  or  19x1245.

Now  let  us look  at  all  the  verses  in  the  Quran,  and count all the l’s we see. This means the 1’s we see in verses 1, 10, 11, 12, 13... 21, 31, and so on. The total count of the l’s is 2546 (19x134),  provided  the  correct  number  of verses in Sura 9, 127, is used. If 128 and 129 are included, the grand total becomes 2548, which  is  not  a multiple  of  19 (Table 11).",

As shown in Table 10, the total count of the digit “1” in the un-initialed suras is 1406, or 19x74. Obviously, if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, we would see two additional l’s, from 128 and 129, and the code would be violated. "

The sum of digits of 10 = 1, 11 = 2, 12 = 3, 99  =  18,  and  so  on.  The  total  for  all  the suras is 975. The same thing is done for the numbers  of  verses  in  every  sura.  For  example,  Sura  2  consists  of  286  verses.  The digits of 286 add up to 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. For Sura  9,  the  digits  of  its  number  of  verses add up to 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. The total for all 114 suras is 906. Thus, the grand total for the sum of digits of all the suras and verses is  975  +  906  =  1881  =  19x99.

For example, Sura 2 has 286 verses. The sum of digits of 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. So you multiply 2 by 16, and you get 32, instead of adding 2 +16 as we did in Item 26. This  is  done  for  every  sura  in  the  Quran.  The  grand  total  for  all  the  suras  is 7771, or 19x409. Once again, every single verse in the Quran is confirmed, while the false verses are utterly rejected. See Table 13.",

If Sura 9 did consist of 129 verses, it would not be included  in  this  list  of  suras, the  total  would  be  10827 (10963-136),  this  phenomenon would  have  disappeared,  and the  Quran’s  code  would  have been violated."

This means that we look at all the suras that consist of 129 or more verses. For example, Sura 2 consists of 286 verses. Therefore, it contains a verse that is assigned the number “129.” We then take this verse and add it to all the other verses assigned the number 129 throughout the Quran. Under this assumption, there are 9 suras that contain a verse No. 129. Interestingly, we find that the total of sura numbers of these 9 suras is a multiple of 19 (114), while the total for the nine 129’s can be a multiple of 19 if 2 is deducted from their total. In other words, we are told that one of these 9 suras contains 2 extra verses. The details are in Table 27.",

The total of suras and verses becomes divisible by 19 only if Sura 9 is removed. Note that the divisible total, after removing Sura 9, is 1273, 19x67, which is the same total obtained in Item 43 above after removing 2 verses. This remarkable phenomenon proves that Sura 9 could not contain a verse No. 128.",

For example, the last two verses in Sura 1 are 6 and 7. Add 6 + 7 and you get 13. The next un-initialed sura is Sura 4; its last two verses are 175 and 176. Add 175 +176 and you get 351. Do this for all un-initialed suras. The data are in Table 29. Thus, the last two verses of Sura 9 are confirmed to be 126 and 127."

This miraculous phenomenon incontrovertibly authenticates every single verse in the Quran—the number of verses in every sura, and the numbers assigned to every single verse in the Quran—while exposing and rejecting the false injections, 9:128-129. To witness this great phenomenon, see Page 398. Putting the number of every verse in the Quran in sequence from the beginning to the end, with the number of verses in each sura ahead of the verse numbers of each sura, the final number consists of 12692 digits (19x668), and the number itself is also a multiple of 19. If the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 was used—129 instead of 127—neither the number of digits, nor the number itself would be divisible by 19.",

Needless to say, if the wrong number of verses is used, i.e., 129 instead of 127, this remarkable miracle would have disappeared:",

Mr. Arik used the same computer program he devised for Item 62 above to check all odd-numbered verses in the Quran. Thus, the number of verses in every sura was written down, followed only by the last digit of each of the odd-numbered verses in that sura. Sura 1 was represented by the number 71357. Sura 2 was represented by the number 28613579....5, and so on through the last sura. The result is a long number, with 3371 digits, that is divisble by 19. Obviously, Sura 9 was represented by the number 12713579...... 7:",

The number of every verse in each of the 85 suras was written down, without the number of verses in the sura. Thus, Sura 1 was represented by the number 1234567, not 71234567. This was done with all un-initialed suras. The final result is a number that consists of 6635 digits, and is a multiple of 19. These awesome phenomena would be destroyed if we used the wrong number of verses for Sura 9, i.e., 129 instead of 127."

But the Muslims, as early as the first century AH, do not want God if Muhammad is not invoked along with Him. This is easily demonstrable today by going into any mosque and declaring: “LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH;” this will actually enrage today’s Muslims. This behavior is documented in the Quran, 39:45. Moreover, my own research has now convinced me that the traditional Muslims are forbidden by God from uttering the Quranic, divinely dictated Shahaadah: “Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah.” They can never say this Shahaadah (without invoking Muhammad’s name). Test them yourself. The First Pillar of the distorted Islam, LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH, MUHAMMAD RASOOL ALLAH, does not conform with God’s commandments that came to us through Muhammad (see Appendix 13)."

            "1": "The ignorant Muslim scholars then decided to proclaim Muhammad an illiterate man! They figured that this would make the Quran’s extraordinary literary excellence truly miraculous. The word they relied on to bestow illiteracy upon the Prophet was “UMMY.” Unfortunately for those “scholars,” this word clearly means “Gentile,” or one who does not follow any scripture (Torah, Injeel, or Quran) [see 2:78, 3:20 & 75, 62:2]; it does NOT mean “illiterate.”",
            "2": "The Prophet was a successful merchant. The “Muslim scholars” who fabricated the illiteracy lie forgot that there were no numbers during the Prophet’s time; the letters of the alphabet were used as numbers. As a merchant dealing with numbers every day, the Prophet had to know the alphabet, from one to one-thousand.",
            "3": "The Quran tells us that Muhammad wrote down the Quran—Muhammad’s contemporaries are quoted as saying, “These are tales from the past that he wrote down. They are being dictated to him day and night” (25:5). You cannot “dictate” to an illiterate person. The Prophet’s enemies who accuse him of illiteracy abuse Verse 29:48, which relates specifically to previous scriptures.",
            "4": "On the 27th night of Ramadan 13 B.H. (Before Hijerah), Muhammad the soul, the real person, not the body, was summoned to the highest universe and the Quran was given to him (2:97, 17:1, 44:3, 53:1-18, 97:1-5). Subsequently, the angel Gabriel helped Muhammad release a few verses of the Quran at a time, from the soul to Muhammad’s memory. The Prophet wrote down and memorized the verses just released into his mind. When the Prophet died, he left the complete Quran written down with his own hand in the chronological order of revelation, along with specific instructions as to where to place every verse. The divine instructions recorded by the Prophet were designed to put the Quran together into the final format intended for God’s Final Testament to the world (75:17). The early Muslims did not get around to putting the Quran together until the time of Khalifa Rashed ‘Uthmaan. A committee was appointed to carry out this task. Read Appendix 24 for the details.",
            "7": "Every sura in the Quran opens with the statement “In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful,” known as the Basmalah, with the exception of Sura 9. This conspicuous absence of the Basmalah from Sura 9 has been an intriguing feature of the Quran for 14 centuries. Many theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon.",
            "8": "Now we learn that the missing Basmalah plays a significant role as [1] a significant constituent of the Quran’s mathematical miracle, and [2] a glaring sign from the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, that Sura 9 has been tampered with and must be purified (Appendix 24). Both roles of the missing Basmalah were revealed with the discovery of the Quran’s mathematical code. The following list of factual observations illustrate the miraculous features of the missing Basmalah:"

But the absence of the Basmalah from Sura 9 causes the number of this crucial opening statement to be 113, a number that does not conform with the Quran’s code. However, we find that this deficiency is compensated for in Sura 27. Two Basmalahs occur in Sura 27, one as an opener and one in Verse 30. This restores the total number of Basmalahs in the Quran to 114, 19x6.",

This is a mathematical property, any consecutive 19 numbers will add up to a multiple of 19. But the miraculous phenomenon is that this number, 342, equals the number of words from the first Basmalah of Sura 27 to the second Basmalah in 27:30.",
            "4": "[4] The occurrence of the extra Basmalah in 27:30 conforms with the Quran’s code in that the sura number, plus the verse number is a multiple of 19 (27 + 30 = 57 = 19x3).",

The absence of the Basmalah from Sura 9, and compensating for it in Verse 30 of Sura 27 gives us two numbered Basmalahs, 1:1 & 27:30, and 112 un-numbered Basmalahs. This causes the total number of verses in the Quran to be 6234 + 112 = 6346, 19x334."

As detailed in Table 4, these are Suras 9, 11, 13, 15,17, 25, and 27. By adding the digits that make up the sura numbers and the numbers of verses, the grand total is 114, 19x6.",

If we take the same suras listed in Table 4, odd-numbered suras whose numbers of verses are also odd, and write down the number of every sura, followed by its number of verses, the resulting long number (30 digits) is a multiple of 19 (Figure 1)."

During the remaining 13 years of his life, he married the aged widows of his friends who left many children. The children needed a complete home, with a fatherly figure, and the Prophet provided that. Providing a fatherly figure for orphans is the only specific circumstance in support of polygamy mentioned in the Quran (4:3).",

Thus, the probability of obtaining any combination is 1 in 120, or 1/120, or 0.0086. This probability diminishes fast when we increase the number of cubes.

In America’s society of the eighties, even parents start talking about boyfriends for their daughters and girlfriends for their sons. When they reach their teens, many parents even supply birth control means to their children. An alarming percentage of teen-agers are sexually active, even though they are not physiologically mature, and without any moral limitations. Millions of illicit pregnancies and the tragedies associated with them, plus millions of tragic abortions, happen every month in the USA.",

God’s advice to keep our chastity, before and after marriage, is for our own good. God is the one who controls our health, wealth, and happiness or misery (53:43, 53:48).",

In 2:219 and 5:90, we see that “intoxicants, gambling, the idols’ altars, and games of chance” are strictly prohibited. The word used for intoxicants is “Khamr” from the root word “Khamara” which means “to cover.” Thus, anything that covers or hinders the mind is prohibited. This includes anything that alters the mind, such as marijuana, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, hashish, and anything else that affects the mind."

The sura and verse numbers add up to 5 + 38 = 43. The other place in the Quran where “the hand is cut” is found in 12:31. This is where we see the women who admired Joseph so much, they “cut” their hands. Obviously, they did not sever their hands; no one can do that. The sura and verse numbers add up to 12 + 31 = 43, the same total as in 5:38. This gives mathematical confirmation that the Quranic law calls for marking the hand of the thief, not severing it. Additional mathematical confirmation is provided: 19 verses after 12:31, we see the “cutting of the hand” again. Punishment in Islam (Submission) is based on equivalence and social pressure (2:178, 5:38, 24:2).",

As stated in 24:2, the punishment for adultery is whipping in public; a hundred symbolic lashes. As pointed out above, the basic punishment is social pressure and scandalizing the criminal. Whipping in public achieves this goal.",
            "9": "In dealing with murder, the Quran definitely discourages capital punishment (2:179). “The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female” (2:178). Due to human meanness and injustice, many people cannot even imagine what this Quranic law says. They refuse to accept the clear injunctions that strict equivalence must be observed—if a woman kills a man, or a man kills a woman, or a slave kills a free person, or a free person kills a slave, capital punishment cannot be applied. The Quran prefers that the murderer compensate the victim’s family. Killing the murderer does not bring the victim back, nor does the family of the victim benefit from executing the murderer. The compensation, however, must be sufficient to be a deterrent for others. In Islam (Submission), the victim and/or the victim’s family are the judges for all crimes; they decide what the punishment shall be under the supervision of a person who knows the Quran."
