It is all gross falsehood, because there are only nineteen times that the Holy Name is mentioned [in that portion of the morning prayer]... and similarly you find the word ’Elohim nineteen times in the pericope of Ve-’elleh shemot. . . . Similarly, you find that Israel were called “sons” nineteen times, and there are many other examples. All these sets of nineteen are intricately intertwined, and they contain many secrets and esoteric meanings, which are contained in more than eight large volumes...

His  mission  is  to  purify  and  unify  all  existing  religions  into  one:  Islam  (Submission). \n\nIslam  is  NOT  a  name;  it  is  a  description  of  one’s  total  submission  and devotion  to  God  ALONE,  without  idolizing  Jesus,  Mary,  Muhammad,  or the  saints.  Anyone  who  meets  this  criterion  is  a  “Muslim”  (Submitter). Therefore,  one  may  be  a  Muslim  Jew,  a  Muslim  Christian,  a  Muslim Hindu, a Muslim Buddhist, or Muslim Muslim.\n\nGod’s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  delivers  God’s  proclamation  that  “The only  religion  approved  by  God  is  Submission”  (3:19)  and  that  “Anyone who  seeks  other  than  Submission  as  a  religion,  it  will  not  be  accepted from him/her” (3:85).\n\nA  messenger  of  God  must  present  proof  that  he  is  God’s  messenger.  Every messenger  of  God  is  supported  by  incontrovertible  divine  signs  proving that  he  is  authorized  by  the  Almighty  to  deliver  His  messages.  Moses  threw down  his  staff  and  it  turned  into  a  serpent,  Jesus  healed  the  leprous  and revived  the  dead  by  God’s  leave,  Saaleh’s  sign  was  the  famous  camel, Abraham  walked  out  of  the  fire,  and  Muhammad’s  miracle  was  the Quran (29:50-51). \n\nThe  Quran  (3:81,  33:7,  33:40)  and  the  Bible  (Malachi  3:1-3)  have prophesied  the  advent  of  the  consolidating  messenger,  God’s  Messenger  of the  Covenant.  It  is  only  befitting  that  a  messenger  with  such  a  crucial mission  must  be  supported  by  the  most  powerful  miracle  (74:30-35). While  the  miracles  of  previous  messengers  were  limited  in  time  and  place, God’s  miracle  supporting  His  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  is  perpetual;  it can be witnessed by anyone, at anytime, in any place. \n\nThis  Appendix  presents  physical,  examinable,  verifiable,  and  irrefutable evidence that Rashad Khalifa is God’s Messenger of the Covenant."

           "7": "1. In Sura 2, Verses 127, 128, and 129 end with two different names of God each. These pairs of names are “Al-Samee‘Al-‘Aleem (The Hearer, the Omniscient),” “Al-Tawwaab Al-Raheem (The Redeemer, Most Merciful)”, and “Al- ‘Azeez Al-Hakeem (The Almighty, Most Wise),” respectively. If this were a regular book, one would easily mis-match these six names. Not so in the Quran. Each one of these pairs is preceded in the same verse by a “Memory Bell” that reminds us of the correct pair of names. Thus, Verse 127 talks about Abraham and Ismail raising the foundations of the Ka‘abah. The verse ends with the names “Al-Samee‘ Al-‘Aleem.” The prominent sounds here are the “S,” “M,” and “ ‘Ayn.” These three letters are prominent in the word “Ismail.” We find that this word is conspicuously delayed in the sentence, while improving its literary quality. Thus, we find that the verse goes like this: “When Abraham raised the foundations of the Ka‘abah, together with Ismail ...” Normally, a human writer would say, “When Abraham and Ismail raised the foundations of the Ka‘abah...” But delaying the sounds in “Ismail” brings them closer to the end of the verse, and thus reminds us that the correct names of God in this verse are “Al-Samee‘ Al-‘Aleem.”",
           "8": "Verse 128 has the prominent word “Tubb” just before the names “Al-Tawwaab Al-Raheem.” The word “Tubb” thus serves as the memory bell. The names of God at the end of 2:129 are “Azeez, Hakeem.” The prominent sounds here are “Z” and “K.” Obviously, the memory bell in this verse is the word “Yuzakkeehim”"

           "1": "2. Another good example is found in 3:176, 177, & 178, where the retribution for disbelievers is described as “ ‘Azeem (Terrible),” Aleem (Painful),” and “Muheen (Humiliating),” respectively. In a human-made book, the memorizer could easily mix up these three descriptions. But we find that each of these adjectives is preceded by powerful memory bells that prevent such a mix-up. The word “ ‘Azeem” of Verse 176 is preceded by the word “Huzzun” which is characterized by a stressed letter “Z.” This serves to remind us of the particular adjective at the end of this verse. The word “Aleem” of Verse 177 is preceded by the sound of the word “Iman” to serve as a memory bell, and the word “Muheen” of 3:178 is preceded by an abundance of “M” and “H” throughout this verse.",
           "2": "Other examples of memory bells include the ending of 3:173 and the beginning of 3:174, the ending of 4:52 and the beginning of 4:53, the ending of 4:61 and the beginning of 4:62, the ending of 18:53 and the beginning of 18:54, and many more.",
           "5": "We learn from 41:44 that the sincere believers have access to the Quran, regardless of their mother tongue. The disbelievers, on the other hand, are not permitted access to the Quran, even if they are professors of the Arabic language (17:45, 18:57, 41:44, & 56:79).",
           "6": "Arabic is the most efficient language in the world, especially when it comes to the precise statement of laws. Since the Quran is a Statute Book, it was crucial that such laws must be clearly stated. God chose Arabic for His Final Testament because of the obvious reason that it is the most suitable language for that purpose. Arabic is unique in its efficiency and accuracy. For example, the word “they” in English does not tell you if “they” are males or females. In Arabic there is a “they” for the males, “HUM,” and a “they” for the females, “HUNNA.” There is even a “they” for two males, “HUMAA,” and a “they” for two females, “HAATAAN.” This feature does not exist in any other language in the world. I came to appreciate this efficiency of the Arabic language when I translated, for example, 2:228. This verse enjoins the divorcee to give up her own wishes to divorce her husband, if she discovers that she is pregnant, and the husband wishes to reconcile—the welfare of the child takes a priority. The efficiency of the Arabic language was extremely helpful in stating this law. Any other language would have made it almost impossible to point out whose wishes are to be superseded, at least not in such a few words as we see in 2:228.",
           "7": "The word “Qaalataa” of 28:23, for example, translates into four English words: “the two women said.” Such is the efficiency of the Arabic language.",
           "8": "Another possible reason for choosing Arabic is the fact that “He” and “She” do not necessarily imply natural gender. Thus, when God is referred to as “He,” this does not imply gender at all. God be glorified; He is neither male, nor female. The usage of “He” to refer to God in the English language, for example, has contributed to a false image of God. This was not helped by such distorted expressions as “Father” when referring to God. You never find such a reference to God in the Quran."

Muhammad will then ask God whether this person deserves his intercession or not. God will inform Muhammad that the person deserves to go to Paradise.

On the contrary, God intervened to save Abraham and Ismail from Satan’s plot (37:107), and He told Abraham: “You believed the dream” (37:105). Undoubtedly, it was a dream inspired by Satan.

           "1": "Islam is called “Millat Ibrahim” (The Religion of Abraham) throughout the Quran (2:130, 135; 3:95; 4:125; 6:161; 12:37-38; 16:123; 21:73; 22:78). Moreover, the Quran informs us that Muhammad was a follower of Abraham (16:123).",
           "2": "Due to a general unawareness of the fact that Abraham was the original messenger of Islam, many so-called Muslims challenge God: “If the Quran is complete and fully detailed (as claimed by God), where can we find the number of Rak‘ahs (units) in each contact prayer (Salat)?” We learn from the Quran that all religious practices of Islam (Submission) were already established before the Quran’s revelation (8:35, 9:54, 16:123, 21:73, 22:27, 28:27). Verse 16:123 is direct proof that all religious practices in Islam were intact when Muhammad was born. Muhammad was enjoined to “follow the religion of Abraham.” If I ask you to buy a color TV, it is assumed that you know what a color TV is. Similarly, when God enjoined Muhammad to follow the practices of Abraham (16:123), such practices must have been well known.",
           "3": "Another proof of divine preservation of the Islamic practices given to Abraham is the “Universal Acceptance” of such practices. There is no dispute concerning the number of Rak‘ahs in all five daily prayers. This proves the divine preservation of Salat. The Quran’s mathematical code confirms the number of Rak‘ahs in the five prayers 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4, respectively. The number 24434 is a multiple of 19.",
           "4": "The Quran deals only with practices that were distorted. For example, the distorted ablution is restored in 5:6 to its original four steps. The tone of voice during the contact prayers (Salat) was distorted—many Muslims pray silently. This was corrected in the Quran, 17:110. The fasting during Ramadan was modified in the Quran to allow intercourse during the night (2:187). Zakat is restored in 6:141, and Hajj is restored to the four correct months (see Appendix 15).",
           "7": "In the English speaking world, where the trinity doctrine is prevalent, some people are intrigued by God’s usage of the plural tense in the Quran. The overwhelming message of the Quran, where there is absolutely no compromise is that “GOD IS ONE” (2:133, 163; 4:171; 5:73; 6:19; 9:31; 12:39; 13:16; 14:48, 52; 16:22, 51; 18:110; 21:108; 22:34; 37:4; 38:65; 39:4; 40:16; 41:6; 112:1).",
           "8": "Whenever the first person plural form is used by the Almighty, it invariably indicates participation of other entities, such as the angels. For example, the revelation of this Quran involved participation of the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad. Hence the use of the plural form in 15:9: “We revealed this scripture, and we will preserve it.” The plural form here simply reflects the fact that the angel Gabriel and the prophet Muhammad participated in the process of delivering the Quran."

Thus, the first person singular form is consistently used: “I blew into Adam from My spirit” (15:29, 38:72). The creation of Jesus, on the other hand, took place on earth, and Gabriel carried God’s “word” to Mary. The plural form is consistently used when referring to the creation of Jesus (21:91, 66:12).",
           "2": "When God spoke to Moses directly, without the mediation of angels, we see that God is speaking exclusively in the singular tense: “I am God. There is no other god besides Me. You shall worship Me alone, and observe the regular contact prayers (Salat) to commemorate Me.” (20:12-14).",
           "3": "Whenever the worship of God is mentioned, the singular tense is used (51:56).",

Similarly, we live here on earth, and when we exit the grave on the Day of Resurrection we will not be earthbound; like the butterfly (101:4).",

Since our universe is a temporary dominion for Satan, it cannot stand the physical presence of God (7:143). As the Almighty approaches, the stars will crash into one another (77:8, 81:2), and the earth will shatter under our feet (69:14, 89:21). These horrors will not worry the believers (21:103).",

Those who nourished their souls through worshiping God alone, believing in the Hereafter, and leading a righteous life will be strong enough to stay close to God; they will occupy the highest ranks (see Appendix 5).",

           "14": "There will be people who nourished their souls just enough to spare them Hell, but not enough to enter the Lower Heaven. They are neither in Hell, nor in Heaven. They will implore God to admit them into the Lower Heaven (7:46- 50). God will have mercy on them, and will merge the Purgatory into the Lower Heaven.",
           "16": "A new, eighth universe will be created to house those who run away from God due to their weakness; they failed to nourish and develop their souls (69:17). God does not put a single being in Hell; they go to it of their own volition (Appendix 5)."

Those who are attracted to Hadith and Sunna are proven to be false believers (6:113). Ironically, the books of Hadith report the Prophet’s orders to write down nothing from him except the Quran!

They simply cannot say: “Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah” by itself, without mentioning the name of Muhammad. Try it with any idol worshiper who claims to be a Muslim. Challenge them to say: “Ash-hadu Allaa Elaaha Ellaa Allah.” They can never say it.

One example of God’s guidance for those who deserve guidance is found in 21:51: “We granted Abraham his guidance, for we were fully aware of him.” In other words, God knew that Abraham was a good soul who deserved to be guided, and God granted him his guidance and understanding. Another good example is stated in 12:24. Joseph fell for the Egyptian nobleman’s wife, and almost committed adultery “if it were not that he saw a sign from his Lord.” God teaches us in 12:24 that He “diverted evil and sin from Joseph, for he was one of My devoted worshipers.” Was it Joseph who controlled his lust? Or, was it God’s protection from sin that rendered him chaste? Such is predestination."

Cleanliness, bathing, and regular hygiene practices are encouraged. Upon arrival at the Sacred Mosque in Mecca, the pilgrim walks around the Ka‘bah seven times, while glorifying and praising God (2:125, 22:26-29). The common formula is: “Labbayka Allaahumma Labbayk” (My God, I have responded to You). “Labbayka Laa Shareeka Laka Labbayk” (I have responded to You, and I proclaim that there is no other god besides You; I have responded to You).

After sunset, the pilgrim goes to Muzdalifah where the Night Prayer is observed, and 21 pebbles are picked up for the symbolic stoning of Satan at Mina. From Muzdalifah, the pilgrim goes to Mina to spend two or three days (2:203). On the first morning at Mina, the pilgrim offers an animal sacrifice to feed the poor and to commemorate God’s intervention to save Ismail and Abraham from Satan’s trick (37:107, Appendix 9). The stoning ceremonies symbolize rejection of Satan’s polytheism and are done by throwing seven pebbles at each of three stations, while glorifying God (15:34).

           "1": "Some Muslims compromise: “If a Hadith agrees with the Quran we will accept it, and if it contradicts the Quran, we will reject it!” Such premise proves that these people do not believe God’s assertions that the Quran is “complete, perfect and fully detailed.” The moment they seek guidance from anything besides the Quran, no matter how “right” it seems, they fall into Satan’s trap (see 63:1). For they have rejected God’s word and set up another god besides God (18:57). See Appendix 33.",

           "8": "Unlike any other book, the Quran is taught by God (55:1-2); He teaches us what we need at the time we need it. This is why we read the Quran hundreds of times without getting bored. We can read a novel, for example, only once. But the Quran can be read an infinite number of times, and we derive new and valuable information from it every time. On the other hand, the insincere readers—those who read the Quran to find fault with it—are diverted from the Quran (7:146, 17:45, 18:57, 41:44). In fact, God’s invisible forces help them find the faults they seek. Since the Quran is perfect, such “faults” serve only to reveal the stupidity of God’s enemies.",
           "9": "God uses His own attributes to describe the Quran; He calls the Quran “ ‘Azeem = Great” (15:87), “Hakeem = Full of wisdom” (36:2), “Majid = Glorious” (50:1), and “Karim = Honorable” (56:77). What can we say?",
           "10": "Since the Quran is God’s message to all the people, regardless of their language, the Quran is accessible to the believers, regardless of their language (41:44). This explains a profound phenomenon: the believers who do not know Arabic know the Quran better than the Arabic speaking unbelievers. Because of the invisible forces serving the Quran, it is readily and enjoyably accessible to the sincere believers, and utterly inaccessible to the unbelievers (17:45, 18:57, 56:79)."

The evidence \npresented in this  Appendix  incontrovertibly  removes  these human  injec-\ntions, restores the Quran to its pristine purity, and illustrates a major func-\ntion of the Quran\u2019s mathematical code, namely, to protect the Quran from \nthe  slightest  tampering.  Thus,  the  code  rejects  ONLY  the  false  injections \n9:128-129. \n\nSurely, we have revealed this scripture, and surely, we will preserve it. \n\n [ 15:9 ] \n\nThe Quran is God\u2019s Final Testament. Hence the divine pledge to keep it per-\nfectly  preserved.  To  assure  us  of  both  the  divine  authorship,  and  the  perfect \npreservation  of  the  Quran,  the  Almighty  author  has  rendered  the  Quran  mathe-\nmatically  composed.  As  proven  by  the  physical  evidence  in  Appendix  1,  such \nmathematical composition is far beyond human capabilities. The slightest viola-\ntion of God\u2019s Final Testament is destined to stand out in glaring disharmony. A \ndeviation  by  only  1\u2014one  sura,  one  verse,  one  word,  even  one  letter\u2014is  immedi-\nately exposed. \n\nNineteen  years  after  the  Prophet  Muhammad\u2019s  death,  during  the  reign  of \nKhalifa  \u2018Uthman,  a  committee  of  scribes  was  appointed  to  make  several  copies   \nof  the  Quran  to  be  dispatched  to  the  new  Muslim  lands.  The  copies  were  to  be \nmade from the original Quran which was written by Muhammad\u2019s hand (Appen-\ndix 28). \n\nThis committee was supervised by \u2018Uthman Ibn \u2018Affaan, \u2018Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb, \nZeid  Ibn  Thaabet,  Ubayy  Ibn  Ka\u2018ab,  \u2018Abdullah  Ibn  Al-Zubair,  Sa\u2018eed  Ibn  Al-  \n\u2018Aas, and \u2018Abdul Rahman Ibn Al-Haareth Ibn Heshaam. The Prophet, of course, \nhad  written  the  Quran  in  its  chronological  order  of  revelation  (Appendix  23), \ntogether  with  the  necessary  instructions  to  place  every  piece  in  its  proper  posi-\ntion. The  last  sura revealed in Medina was Sura 9. Only  Sura 110, a very short \nsura, was revealed after Sura 9, in Mina. \n\nThe  committee  of  scribes  finally  came  to  Sura  9,  and  put  it  in  its  proper   \n\nplace.  One  of  the  scribes  suggested  adding  a  couple  of  verses  to  honor  the \nProphet. The majority of scribes agreed. \u2018Ali was outraged. He vehemently main-\ntained  that  the  word  of  God,  written  down  by  the  hand  of  His  final  prophet,    \nmust never be altered. \n\n \n\f"

This  apparent  victory  for    \nGod\u2019s enemies was, of course, in accordance with God\u2019s will. In just two decades \nafter the Prophet\u2019s death, the idol worshipers who were defeated by the Prophet  \nin  the  conquest  of  Mecca  (632  AD)  reverted  to  idolatry.  Ironically,  this  time \naround  their  idol  was  the  Prophet  himself.  Such  idol  worshipers  obviously  did  \nnot deserve to possess the pure Quran. Hence the blessed martyrdom of the true \nbelievers  who  tried  to  restore  the  Quran,  and  the  apparent  victory  for  the  dis-\ntorters of God\u2019s word. \n\nThe  first  peace  time  ruler  after  this  lengthy  and  disastrous  war  was  Marwan \nIbn  Al  Hakam  (died 65 AH/684  AD).  One  of  the  first  duties  he performed  was   \nto  destroy  the  original  Quran,  the  one  that  was  so  scrupulously  written  by  the \nProphet\u2019s own hand, \u201cfearing it might become the cause of NEW disputes\u201d [see \n\u2018ULUM  AL-QURAN,  by  Ahmad  von  Denffer,  Islamic  Foundation,  Leicester, \nUnited Kingdom, 1983, Page 56]. The question an intelligent person must ask is: \n\u201cIf  the  original  Quran  were  identical  to  the  Quran  in  circulation  at  that  time,    \nwhy did Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam have to destroy it?!\u201d \n\nUpon examining the oldest Islamic references, we realize that the false injec-\ntions, 9:128-129, were always suspect. For example, we read in Bukhary\u2019s famous \nHadith, and Al-Suyuty\u2019s famous Itqaan, that every single verse in the Quran was \nverified by a multiplicity of witnesses \u201cexcept Verses 128 and 129 of Sura 9; they \n\n \n \n\f"

This total is obtained by ad-\nding the numbers of verses wherever the \nword  \u201cGod\u201d  is  found.  If  the  false  Verse \n9:129  is  included,  this  phenomenon  dis-\nappears. \n\n[3]  As  shown  at the  end  of  Sura  9 in \nthis  translation,  the  total  occurrence  of \nthe  word  \u201cGod\u201d  to  the  end  of  Sura  9  is \n1273, 19x67. If the false injections 9:128-\n129  were  included,  the  total  would  have \nbecome 1274, not a multiple of 19. \n\n[4]  The  occurrence  of \n\nthe  word  \n\u201cGod\u201d  from  the  first  Quranic  initial \n(\u201cA.L.M.\u201d of 2:1) to the last initial (\u201cN.\u201d \nof 68:1) totals 2641, or 19x139. Since it is \neasier  to  list  the  suras  outside  the  ini-       \ntialed  section  of  the  Quran,  Table  1 \nshows  the  57  occurrences  of  the  word \n\u201cGod\u201d  in  that  section.  Subtracting  57 \nfrom  the  total  occurrence  of  the  word \n\u201cGod\u201d  gives  us  2698-57  =  2641  = \n19x139,  from  the  first  initial  to  the  last \ninitial. If the human injections 9:128 and \n129 were included, the count of the word \n\u201cGod\u201d  in  the  initialed  section  would   \nhave become 2642, not a multiple of 19. \n\n[5] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, and \nif we look at the 85 un-initialed suras, we \nfind that the word \u201cGod\u201d occurs in 57 of \nthese  suras,  19x3.  The  total  number  of \nverses  in  the  suras  where  the  word   \n\u201cGod\u201d is found is 1045, 19x55. If 9:128-\n129 were included, the verses containing \nthe word \u201cGod\u201d would increase by 1. \n\n[6]  The  word  \u201cGod\u201d  from  the  miss-\ning  Basmalah  (Sura  9)  to  the  extra  Bas-\nmalah  (Sura  27)  occurs  in  513  verses, \n19x27,  within  19  suras  (Table  2).  If  the \nfalse Verses 9:128-129 were included, the \nnumber  of  verses  containing  the  word \n\u201cGod\u201d would have become 514, and this \nphenomenon would have disappeared. \n\n[7]  The  word  \u201cElaah\u201d  which  means \n\u201cgod\u201d occurs in Verses 9:129.

            "1": "Appendix 24 \n\n447 \n\noccurrence  of  this  word  in  the  Quran  is  95,  19x5.  The  inclusion  of  9:128-129 \ncauses this word to increase by 1, to 96. \n\n[8]  The  INDEX  TO  THE  WORDS  OF  THE  QURAN,  lists  116  \u201cRasool\u201d \n(Messenger) words. One of these words is in 9:128. By removing this false verse, \n115  \u201cRasool\u201d  words  remain.  Another  \u201cRasool\u201d  word  which  must  be  excluded \nfrom counting is in 12:50, since it refers to the \u201cmessenger of Pharaoh,\u201d not the \nmessenger of God. Thus, the total occurrence of \u201cRasool\u201d of God is 114, 19x6. \n\n[9]  Another  important  word  that  occurs  in  the  false  Verses  9:128-129  is  the \nword  \u201cRaheem\u201d  (Merciful).  This  word  is  used  in  the  Quran  exclusively  as  a   \nname of God, and its total count is 114,19x6, after removing the word \u201cRaheem\u201d \nof 9:128, which refers to the prophet. According to 7:188, 10:49, and 72:21 the \nProphet did not possess any power of mercy. \n\n[10]  The  INDEX  lists  22  occurrences  of  the  word  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  (Throne).  After \nremoving  the  false  injection  9:129,  and  the  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  of  Joseph  which  occurs  in \n12:100,  and  the  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  of  the  Queen  of  Sheba  (27:23),  we  end  up  with  19           \n\u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  words.  This  proves  that  the  word  \u201c  \u2018Arsh\u201d  of  9:129  does  not  belong  in     \nthe Quran. \n\n[11] The Quranic command \u201cQul\u201d (Say) occurs in the Quran 332 times. Also, \nthe word \u201cQaaloo\u201d (They said) occurs the same number of times, 332. Since the \nfalse  Verse  9:129  contains  the  word  \u201cQul\u201d  (Say),  its  inclusion  would  have \ndestroyed this typical Quranic phenomenon. \n\n[12] The Quran contains 6234 numbered verses and 112 un-numbered verses \n(Basmalahs). Thus, the total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, 19x334. The \nfalse Verses 9:128-129 violate this important criterion of the Quran\u2019s code. \n\n[13] In addition to violating the numbers of words as listed above, 9:128-129 \nviolate the Quran\u2019s mathematical structure. When we add the number of verses in \neach sura, plus the sum of verse numbers (1 + 2 + 3 +... + n, where n = number   \nof  verses),  plus  the  number  of  each  sura, \nthe  cumulative  total  for  the  whole  Quran \ncomes  to  346199,  or  19x19x959.  This \nphenomenon  confirms  the  authenticity  of \nevery  verse  in the Quran,  while  excluding \n9:128-129.  Table  3  is  an  abbreviated  il-\nlustration  of  the  calculations  of  Item  13. \nThis  phenomenon  is  impossible  if  the  \nfalse Verses 9:128-129 are included. \n\n  Table 3: Mathematical coding of the   \nQuran\u2019s suras & verses, based on \u201c19\u201d. \n\nSura    No. of   Sum of  \n No.    Verses    Verse #\u2019s    Total \n  1          7 \n36 \n          28 \n    41329 \n  2        286         41041 \n        . \n   .   \n     8264 \n  9        127          8128 \n        . \n            .  \n   .   \n  . \n      141 \n          21 \n 114        6 \n6555    6234        333410    346199 \n\n[14]  When  we  carry  out  the  same  cal-\nculations  as  in  Item  13  above,  but  for  the \n85  un-initialed  suras  only,  which  include \nSura 9, the cumulative total is also a mul-\ntiple  of  19.  The  cumulative  total  for  all  \nun-initialed suras is 156066, or 19x8214. This result depends on the fact that Sura \n9 consists of 127 verses, not 129. The data are shown in Table 4.

Obviously, if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, we would see two \nadditional l\u2019s, from 128 and 129, and the code would be violated. \n\n[23]  Following  the  same  process  explained  in  Items  22  and  23  for  the  digit \n\u201c1,\u201d  let  us  count  all  the  2\u2019s,  8\u2019s  and  9\u2019s  in  all  the  verse  numbers  of  the  whole \nQuran. As shown in Table 11, the total count of all the 2\u2019s, 8\u2019s, and 9\u2019s is 3382, or \n19x178. This makes the grand total of all the l\u2019s, 2\u2019s, 8\u2019s, and 9\u2019s 2546 + 3382       \n= 5928, 19x312. \n\nTable 11: Counting the digits that make up 128 and 129 in the whole Quran. \n\nSura      # of 1\u2019s      # of 2\u2019s      # of 8\u2019s \n  1   \n  2   \n  . \n  9   \n 10   \n  . \n114  \n\n    1  \n  159 \n    .   \n   61 \n   31 \n    .   \n    1  \n\n# of 9\u2019s   \n     0 \n    48 \n     .  \n    22 \n    21 \n     .  \n     0 \n\n0 \n      55 \n       . \n      22 \n      21 \n       . \n       0 \n    \u2026\u2026.                \u2026\u2026. \n   833 \n     908   \n\n  1   \n       146  \n  . \n 31   \n 21   \n  . \n  1   \n      \u2026\u2026. \n1641 \n\nTotal \n   2 \n 408 \n   . \n 136 \n  94 \n   . \n   2   \n                    \u2026\u2026. \n5928 \n\n       \u2026\u2026. \n       2546 \n   (19 x 134)  \n\n         (19x 312)   \n\nIn  this  remarkable  phenomenon,  we  considered  every  single  verse  in  the \nQuran,  and  examined  the  individual  digits  that  make  up  Verses  128  and  129. \nSince 128 and 129 contain 6 digits, the inclusion of these human injections causes \nthe total count of these digits in the whole Quran to be 5928 + 6 = 5934, not a \nmultiple of 19. \n\n[24] The total count of all the digits (1 through 9) in all the verse numbers of \n\nthe 85 un-initialed suras, including Sura 9 with 127 verses, is 27075, or 19x19x75. \n\n[25] Adding up the digits of the Quran\u2019s suras and verses produces a  multi-     \n\n  Table 12: Sum of digits of all suras  \n & verse numbers in the whole Quran. \n\nple of 19, provided the correct number of verses for Sura 9, 127, is taken. To do \nthis,  you  make  a  list  of  the  Quran\u2019s  114   \nsuras  and  the  number  of  verses  in  each    \nsura.  Add  the  digits  of  every  sura  number. \nThe sum of digits of 10 = 1, 11 = 2, 12 = 3, \n99  =  18,  and  so  on.  The  total  for  all  the  \nsuras is 975. The same thing is done for the \nnumbers  of  verses  in  every  sura.  For  ex-\nample,  Sura  2  consists  of  286  verses.  The \ndigits of 286 add up to 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. For \nSura  9,  the  digits  of  its  number  of  verses  \nadd up to 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. The total for all \n114  suras  is  906.  Thus,  the  grand  total  for \nthe sum of digits of all the suras and verses \nis  975  +  906  =  1881  =  19x99.

Table 12 is abbreviated to illustrate the calcula-\ntions. \n\n[26]  Miraculously,  if  we  calculate  the  sum  of  digits  for  every  sura  in  the \nQuran, and multiply the sum for each sura by the sum of digits of its number of \nverses, instead of adding, we still end up with a grand total that is a multiple of \n19. For example, Sura 2 has 286 verses. The sum of digits of 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. So you \nmultiply 2 by 16, and you get 32, instead of adding 2 +16 as we did in Item 26. \nThis  is  done  for  every  sura  in  the  Quran.  The  grand  total  for  all  the  suras  is    \n7771, or 19x409. Once again, every single verse in the Quran is confirmed, while \nthe false verses are utterly rejected.

The sum of these sura numbers, plus \ntheir sum of verse numbers is 2774, 19x146. If we \ntake the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 , i.e., \n129, this miracle disappears. \n\nAppendix 24 \n\nTable 15: Mathematical coding \nof all suras consisting of 127 \nverses or less. \n\n        8 \n\n  Sura \n    No. of \nNumber   Verses      Total \n    1  \n    5  \n    8  \n    9  \n        . \n    .   \n      118   \n    113 \n    114 \n      120 \n    6434       4529    10963 \n\n      7 \n      120        125 \n      75 \n       83 \n      127        136 \n       . \n      5 \n      6 \n\n[30] The correct number of verses in Sura 9 is \n127,  and  this  is  a  prime  number\u2014it  is  not \ndivisible by any number except 1, and itself. Let \nus look at all the suras whose number of verses is \na prime number. These are Suras 1, 9, 13, 33, 43, \n45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, \nand 113.

If you add the digits of these suras, \nyou get 137, while the digits of the verses add up to 129.

The total of \nthese sura numbers is 71, and the total number of \nverses is 765. This produces a grand total of 71 + \n765 = 836, or 19x44.

There  are  three \nother  suras  in  the  whole  Quran  whose  sura  \ndigits add up to 9 and the digits of their number \nof  verses  add  up  to  10.  These  are  suras  9,  45,  \n54, and 72. They consist of 127, 37, 55, and 28 \nverses, respectively. The total number of verses \nin these three suras is 247, 19x13. \n\nIf  Sura  9  consisted  of  129  verses,  it  would \nnot  be  included  in  this  table  to  begin  with.  See \nTable 21. \n\n[38] If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses as the \ndistorters  claimed,  then  there  is  only  one  other \nsura  in  the  whole  Quran  whose  sura  digits  add \nup to 9, and its number of verses\u2019 digits add up \nto 12, namely Sura 27. \n\nAs shown in Table 22, this combination, with \n129 verses for Sura 9, does not conform with the \nQuran\u2019s code. \n\n[39]  Let  us  assume  for  awhile  that  Sura  9 \nconsists  of  129  verses.

            "1": "Appendix 24 \nbered  suras  whose  number  of  verses  ends \nwith \u201c9.\u201d As shown in Table 24, the total of \nsura number and number of verses in these \nsuras  is  646,  or  19x34.  If  Sura  9  had  129 \nverses, it would have been included in this \ngroup,  and  the  total  would  have  been     \n646 + 129 + 9 = 784, which is not a multi-\nple of 19. \n\n[41] By now, it is incontrovertibly prov-\nen  that  Sura  9  consists  of  127  verses.  Let \nus now look at the suras whose number of \nverses  ends  with  \u201c7.\u201d  There  are  7  such \nsuras;  they  are  Suras  1,  9,  25,  26,  45,  86, \nand  107.  Their  numbers  of  verses  are  7, \n127, 77, 227, 37, 17, and 7 verses, respec-\ntively.  The  grand  total  of  sura  numbers \nplus  number  of  verses  for  these  seven  \nsuras is 798, 19x42. The details are shown \nin Table 25. Thus, every sura whose num-\nber  of  verses  ends  with  the  digit  \u201c7,\u201d  in-\ncluding Sura 9, conforms with the code. \n\n[42]  The  last  two  verses  of  Sura  9  are \n126 and 127. Since the falsifiers added two \nverses, let us look at the last two verses of \nevery  sura  in  the  Quran,  and  count  the  \ndigit \u201c7,\u201d all of them, among these last two \nverses. \n\n455 \n\n  Table 24: Odd numbered suras whose    \n     number of verses ends with \u201c9.\u201d \n\n  Table 25: The suras whose number  \n    of verses ends with the digit \u201c7.\u201d \n\nSura  No. of \n No. \n 15   \n 29   \n 43   \n 57   \n 81   \n 87   \n312  \n\nVerses     Total \n    114 \n   99 \n     98 \n   69 \n    132 \n   89 \n     86 \n   29 \n    110 \n   29 \n    106 \n   19 \n    646 \n  334 \n (19x34) \n\nSura  No. of \n No. \n   1   \n   9   \n  25  \n  26  \n  45  \n  86  \n 107 \n 299 \n\nVerses     Total \n    7  \n  127 \n   77 \n  227 \n   37 \n   17 \n    7  \n  499 \n\n      8 \n    136 \n    102 \n    253 \n     82 \n    103 \n    114 \n    798 \n (19x42) \n\nAs  shown  in  Table  26,  the  total  number  of  the  digit  \u201c7\u201d  among  the  last  two \n\nverses of every sura in the Quran is 38, 19x2. \n\nIf the last verse in Sura 9 was 129 instead of 127, the number of occurrences \n\nof  the  digit  \u201c7\u201d  would  have  been  37,  not  38, \nand this criterion would have been destroyed. \n\n[43]  Assuming  that  Sura  9  consists  of  129 \nverses, let us look at all the suras that contain a \nverse  No.  129.  This  means  that  we  look  at  all \nthe  suras  that  consist  of  129  or  more  verses. \nFor  example,  Sura  2  consists  of  286  verses. \nTherefore,  it  contains  a  verse  that  is  assigned \nthe number \u201c129.\u201d We then take this verse and \nadd it to all the other verses assigned the num-\nber  129  throughout  the  Quran.  Under  this  as-\nsumption, there are 9 suras that contain a verse \nNo. 129. Interestingly, we find that the total of \nsura  numbers  of  these  9  suras  is  a  multiple  of \n19 (114), while the total for the nine 129\u2019s can \nbe a multiple of 19 if 2 is deducted from their \n\n  Table 26: The total number of the \n  digit \u201c7\u201d among the last two   \n  verses of every sura in the Quran. \n\n  7\u2019s in Last 2 \n\n Verses    Verses \n  6,7 \n\n   Sura    Last 2 \n   No \n   1   \n   2       285, 286   \n   3       199, 200   \n   4       175, 176   \n    .   \n   9       126, 127   \n    .   \n   25 \n    .   \n   114 \n\n    .   \n 76, 77   \n    .   \n  5,6 \n\n    .   \n\n1 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n. \n1 \n. \n3 \n. \n0 \n      38 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

The  details  are  in \nTable 27. \n\nWhen we add 114, plus 1161, and remove 2, we \nget 1273, or 19x67. Compare this total (1273) with \nthe  total  reported  in  the  Item  44  below.  Of  the  9 \nsuras listed in Table 27, which one has the extra 2 \nverses? The answer is provided in Item 44. \n\n[44] To pinpoint the location of these two false \nverses,  let  us  look  at  all  the  suras  that  contain  a \nverse  No.  128,  while  continuing  to  assume  that \nSura 9 consists of 129 verses. This will give us the \nsame list of suras as in Table 27, and also bring in \nSura 16 which has precisely 128 verses. \n\nAs shown in Table 28, Sura 9 stands out in glar-\ning  disharmony;  it  is  singled  out  as  the  sura  that \ncontains  the  false  verses.  The  total  of  suras  and \nverses  becomes  divisible  by  19  only  if  Sura  9  is \nremoved. Note that the divisible total, after remov-\ning Sura 9, is 1273, 19x67, which is the same total \nobtained in Item 43 above after removing 2 verses. \nThis  remarkable  phenomenon  proves  that  Sura  9 \ncould not contain a verse No. 128. \n\n[45] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura whose last \ntwo verses are 126 and 127. Let us take the 85 un-\ninitialed  suras,  and  add  up  the  numbers  of  the  last              \ntwo verses in each sura. For example, the last two \nverses in Sura 1 are 6 and 7. Add 6 + 7 and you get \n13. The next un-initialed sura is Sura 4; its last two \nverses are 175 and 176. Add 175 +176 and you get \n351. Do this for all un-initialed suras. The data are \nin Table 29. Thus, the \nlast  two  verses  of  Su- \nra  9  are  confirmed  to \nbe 126 and 127. \n\nTable 29: Abbreviated table \nof the last two verses in the \nun-initialed suras. \n\nAppendix 24 \n\n  Table 27: All suras which    \n  contain a verse number \u201c129.\u201d \n\n Sura No. \n    2  \n    3  \n    4  \n    6  \n    7  \n    9 ? \n    20 \n    26 \n    37 \n    114 \n    (114 + 1161 \u2013 2 = 1273 = \n      19x67) \n\nVerse No.  \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n    129 \n   1161 \n\n  Table 28: All suras containing  \na verse number \u201c128.\u201d \n\nVerse No. \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n    128 \n   1280 \n\nSura No. \n   2   \n   3   \n   4   \n   6   \n   7   \n   9?  \n   16 \n   20 \n   26 \n   37 \n   130 \n   (130 + 1280 = 1410, \n   not a multiple of 19) \n   If we remove sura 9, \n   with its 128 verses, we \n   get 1410 - 9 - 128 = 1273 \n                   = 19x67. \n\n   Sura   Last 2 \n  Total \n   No.    Verses \n   1   \n    13 \n6 + 7 \n   4     175 + 176    351 \n   5     119 + 120    239 \n    .             .      \n   9     126 + 127    253 \n    .   \n   114     5 + 6  \n\n    .              . \n    13 \n  6897 \n\n     . \n\n     (19x363) \n\n[46]  Let  us  now \ntake  the  last  two  ver-\nses  in  every  sura  in  the  Quran,  initialed  and  un-ini-\ntialed,  and  add  the  digits  of  the  last  two  verses  in \neach sura (Table 30). \n\nIt  is  readily  obvious  that  the  last  two  verses  of \nevery  sura  in  the  Quran  are  divinely  fixed,  and \ndivinely  guarded  through  this  intricate  mathemati-   \ncal  code.

Their \nverse  numbers  are  286,  200,  176,  120, \n165, 206, 127, 109, 123, 111, 128, 111, \n110,  135,  112,  118,  227,  and  182, \nrespectively.  By  taking  the  last  digit  in \neach  number  of  verses,  and  adding  up \nthese digits, we get 6 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 5 +  \n6 + 7 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 0 + 5 + 2 + 8 \n+ 7 + 2 =76= 19x4. \n\nIf  Sura  9  consisted  of  129  verses, \nthe  last  digit  in  its  number  of  verses \nwould  be  9  instead  of  7,  and  the  total  \nof  last  digits  would  be  78  instead  of  \n76,  and  this  phenomenon  would  dis-\nappear. \n\n[48] Let us look at the list of suras \nshown  in  Item  47  above.  Since  the \nnumber  of  verses  in  Sura  9  is  an  odd \nnumber,  let  us  now  consider  the  odd-\nnumbered  verse  numbers.  There  are  8 \nsuras  with  a  3-digit,  odd  number  of \nverses:  Suras  6,  9,  10,  11,  12,  17,  20, \nand  26.  Their  numbers  of  verses  are \n165,  127,  109,  123,  111,  111,  135,  & \n227. \n\n  Table 30: Sum of digits of the last two \nverses of every sura in the Quran. \n\n457 \n\n  6, 7 \n\n   Sum \n      the Digits \n          6 + 7 \n\n   Sura    Last 2 \n   No.     Verses   \n   1   \n   2       285, 286         2 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 8 + 6 \n   3       199, 200         1 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 0 + 0  \n    .   \n   9       126, 127   \n\n       . \n\n    .   \n\n   113 \n   114 \n\n    .   \n  4, 5 \n  5, 6 \n\n         . \n\n1 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 7 \n. \n    4 + 5 \n    5 + 6 \n\n           \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n    1824 = 19x96 \n\n Table 31: All suras whose number of  \nverses is odd, and consists of 3 digits. \n\nSura  No. of \nNo.  \n6 \n9 \n10   \n11   \n12   \n17   \n20   \n26   \n\n     Last \nVerses       Digit \n  165 \n  127 \n  109 \n  123 \n  111 \n  111 \n  135 \n  227 \n\n 5 \n 7 \n 9  \n 3 \n 1 \n 1 \n 5 \n 7 \n     \u2026\u2026. \n       38 \n   (19x2) \n\nThe last digits in these numbers of \nverses are 5, 7, 9, 3, 1, 1, 5, and 7,  \nrespectively, and the sum of these digits is 38, or 19x2. Obviously, if Sura 9 con-\nsisted of 129 verses, its last digit would be 9, not 7, and the sum of the last digits \nwould be 40, not a multiple of 19. The detailed data are shown in Table 31. Thus, \nwe  are  getting  more  and  more  specific,  as  we  zoom  in  on  the  last  digit  in  the \nnumber of verses. \n\n[49]  Let  us  continue  to  work  with  the  same  group  of  suras  of  Items  47  and   \n\n48. Since Sura 9 is an odd-numbered sura, let us now remove all the even-num-\nbered suras from the list of suras shown in Item 47. Now we have odd-numbered \nsuras,  with  odd-numbered  verses.  There  are  only  three  such  suras  in  the  whole \nQuran: 9, 11, and 17. Their numbers of verses are 127, 123, and 111 (Table 32). If \nSura  9  consisted  of  129  verses,  this  remarkable  phenomenon  would  have  been \ndestroyed. \n\n[50] Let us continue to work with the three suras listed in Item 49. These are \nall the suras in the Quran whose number is odd (like Sura 9), their number of \n\n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

Just  add  the \nindividual  digits,  and  you  get  1  +  2  +  7  +  1  +              \n2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19. \n\n  Table 32: Odd numbered suras \n  whose number of verses is odd \n  and consists of 3 digits. \nSura No.  No. of Verses \n   9   \n  11  \n  17  \n\n127 \n123 \n111 \n361 \n\nObviously,  this  phenomenon  depends  on  the \nnow proven truth that Sura 9 consists of 127 ver-\nses.  If  Sura  9  consisted  of  129  verses,  the  only \nsuras  in  the  Quran  that  possess  the  above  stated \nqualities would have added up to 1 + 2 + 9 + 1 + 2+ 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21. In other \nwords,  this  important  component  of  the  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  code  would  have \ndisappeared. \n\n   (19x19) \n\n[51]  There  are  three  suras  (1)  whose  numbers  are  odd,  (2)  their  numbers  of   \nverses  are  odd,  and  (3)  the  number  of  verses  consists  of  3  digits.  They  are  Suras:       \n9,  11,  and  17  (see  Items  48  through  50  for  the  flow  of  this  point).  Just  add  the \nindividual  digits \n9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 19. \n\nthat  make  up \n\nthe \n\nthree  sura  numbers,  and  you  get                        \n\n[52] The number 129 is divisible by 3. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses as the \ndistorters  claimed,  then  it  would  be  (1)  an  odd-numbered  sura  that  (2)  consists        \nof  a  3-digit  number  of  verses,  (3)  the  number  of  verses  is  odd,  and  (4)  the  num-      \nber  of  verses  is  divisible  by  3.  There  are  only  two  suras  in  the  whole  Quran  that   \npossess  these  qualities:  Sura  11  with  123  verses,  and  Sura  17  with  111  verses.  The  \nsum  of  digits  of  both  sura  numbers  and  the  numbers  of  verses  comes  to                \n1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19. This can be observed only if Sura 9 con-\nsists of 127 verses. \n\n[53]  Sura  9  is  (1)  odd-numbered,  (2)  its  number  of  verses  is  odd,  (3)  its \nnumber  of  verses  ends  with  the  digit  \u201c7,\u201d  (4)  its  number  of  verses  is  a  prime   \nnumber,  and  (5)  the  sura  number  is  divisible  by  3  &  9.  The  only  two  suras  that    \npossess  these  qualities  are:  Sura  9  (127  verses),  and  Sura  45  (37  verses).  Just  add       \nthe digits you see: \n\n9 + 1 + 2 + 7= 19 & 4 + 5 + 3 + 7= 19; Total for both suras = 19 + 19 = 38. \n\n[54]  Let  us  assume  that  Sura  9  does  have  129  verses.  In  that  case  we  will          \nhave  only  two  suras  in  the  whole  Quran  whose  number  begins  with  9,  and  their           \nnumber  of  verses  ends  with  9:  Sura  9  (129 \nverses)  and  Sura  96  (19  verses).  As   \ndetailed  in  Table  33,  the  grand  total  of    \nsura number, plus the number of verses, plus \nthe  sum  of  verse  numbers  is  8828,  not  a \nmultiple of 19. \n\n  Table 33: Suras whose number begins \n  with \u201c9\u201d and their number of verses \n ends with \u201c9.\u201d \n\n Sura    No. of \n  No.     Verses \n129?  \n   9   \n  19  \n  96  \n 148 \n 105 \n\n  Sum of \n Verse #s   Total \n    8385        8523 \n305 \n     190   \n    8575        8828 \n  (Not multiple of 19) \n\nNow  let  us  remove  the  false  verses  (128        \n\n&  129)  from  Sura  9,  and  repeat  the  same \ncalculations.

Just add the \nsura numbers + number of suras that end with \u201cN\u201d, and you get: \n\n1919. \nThus, the last letter in Sura 9 is once again confirmed to be \u201cN,\u201d not \u201cM.\u201d \n\n[59] Now let us look at the crucial expression \u201cLA ELAAHA ELLA HOO\u201d \n\n(There is no god except He). This phrase occurs in the false injection 9:129. \n\nThis very special expression occurs 29 times in 19 suras (Table 38). By adding \nthe sura numbers of the 19 suras, plus the verse numbers where the phrase \u201cLAA \nELAAHA  ELLA  HOO\u201d  occurs,  plus  the  number  of  occurrences  of  this  crucial \nphrase, the grand total comes to 2128, or 19x112. This awesome result is depend-\nent on the fact that 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran. \n\nObviously, if 9:129 were included, the crucial expression \u201cLA ELAAHA ELLA \n\nHOO,\u201d the First Pillar of Islam, would not conform with the mathematical code. \n\n[60] The first occurrence of \u201cLA ELAAHA ELLA HOO\u201d is in 2:163, and the \nlast occurrence is in 73:9. If we add the sura number, plus the number of verses, \nplus  the  sum  of  verse  numbers  from  the  first  occurrence  to  the  last  occurrence, \nthe grand total comes to 316502, or 19x16658. \n\n\f"

            "1": "462 \n\nAppendix 24 \n\nThe Ultimate Quranic Miracle \n\n[62]  Brother  Abdullah  Arik  has  discovered  what  I  consider  to  be  the  ul-  \ntimate  Quranic  miracle.  This  miraculous  phenomenon  incontrovertibly  authenti-\ncates  every  single  verse  in  the  Quran\u2014the  number  of  verses  in  every  sura,  and   \nthe  numbers  assigned  to  every  single  verse  in  the  Quran\u2014while  exposing  and \nrejecting  the  false  injections,  9:128-129.  To  witness  this  great  phenomenon,  see \nPage 398. Putting the number of every verse in the Quran in sequence from the \nbeginning to the end, with the number of verses in each sura ahead of the verse \nnumbers of each sura, the final number consists of 12692 digits (19x668), and the \nnumber itself is also a multiple of 19. If the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 \nwas  used\u2014129  instead  of  127\u2014neither  the  number  of  digits,  nor  the  number \nitself would be divisible by 19. \n\n[63]  Since  the  subject  of  this  Appendix  is  Sura  9  and  its  number  of  true  \nverses, it is noteworthy that if we write down the number of the sura, 9, followed \nby the correct number of verses, 127, followed by the numbers of all the verses \nfrom 1 to 127, the resulting long number is a multiple of 19. Needless to say, if \nthe  wrong  number  of  verses  is  used,  i.e.,  129  instead  of  127,  this  remarkable \nmiracle would have disappeared: \n    9  127  1  2  3  4  5 ..... 122   123   124   125   126   127. \nThe  total  number  of  verses  in  Sura  9  is  followed  by  the  numbers  of  every    \nverse in the sura from 1 to 127. The resulting long number is a multiple of 19. \n\n[64]  The  number  of  verses  in  Sura  9,  127,  is  an  odd  number.  The  falsifiers \nadded two fake verses, and this made the number of verses 129, which is also an \nodd number. Mr. Arik used the same computer program he devised for Item 62 \nabove to check all odd-numbered verses in the Quran. Thus, the number of ver- \nses in every sura was written down, followed only by the last digit of each of the \nodd-numbered verses in that sura. Sura 1 was represented by the number 71357. \nSura 2 was represented by the number 28613579....5, and so on through the last \nsura.  The  result  is  a  long  number,  with  3371  digits,  that  is  divisble  by  19.  Ob- \nviously, Sura 9 was represented by the number 12713579...... 7: \n\n7 1 3 5 7  286 1 3 5 ... 3 5 ...... 5 1 3 5 6 1 3 5. \nThe  number  of  verses  in  every  sura  is  followed  by  the  last  digit  of  each  odd-\nnumbered verse. The resulting long number, 3371 digits, is a multiple of 19. \n\n[65] Since Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, Mr. Arik applied the same computer \nprogram to all 85 un-initialed suras. The number of every verse in each of the 85 \nsuras was written down, without the number of verses in the sura. Thus, Sura 1 \nwas  represented  by  the  number  1234567,  not  71234567.  This  was  done  with  all \nun-initialed suras. The final result is a number that consists of 6635 digits, and is \na multiple of 19. These awesome phenomena would be destroyed if we used the \nwrong number of verses for Sura 9, i.e., 129 instead of 127. \n\n\f"

The  item  presented  here  is  another  \none of those numerous proofs; it is chosen for its relevance to this Appendix. \n\nThe  gematrical  value  of  the  word  \u201cRashad,\u201d  as  written  in  the  Quran  (40:29, \n38) is 505 (R = 200, Sh = 300, A = 1, and D = 4). The gematrical value of the word \n\u201cKhalifa,\u201d as written in the Quran (38:26) is 725 (Kh = 600, L = 30, I = 10, F = 80, \nand  H  =  5).  By  writing  down  the  value  of  \u201cRashad,\u201d  followed  by  the  value  of \n\u201cKhalifa,\u201d followed by the number of Sura 9, followed by the correct number of \nverses in this sura, the product is 5057259127. This number is a multiple of 19; it \nequals 19 x 266171533. \n\n[67]  The  number  of  verses  from \n3:81,  where  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the \nCovenant  is  prophesied,  to  9:127,  the \nend of Sura 9, is 988 (19x52). Table 41. \n\n[68]  The  sum  of  verse  numbers \nfrom 3:81 to 9:127 is also a multiple of \n19 (Table 41). \n\n[69]  In  Verse  3:78,  just  3  verses \nbefore  proclaiming  God\u2019s  Messenger  \nof the Covenant, the word \u201cGod\u201d num-\nber  361  (19x19)  occurs.  This  verse \n(3:78)  informs  us  that  some  falsifiers \nwill  \u201cadd  falsehood  to  the  Quran,  then \nclaim  that  it  is  part  of  the  Quran;  they \nattribute lies to God, knowingly.\u201d \n\n[70]  The  word  \u201cGod\u201d  occurs  912 \ntimes  (19x48)  from  Verse  3:78,  which \nexposes the falsifiers, to 9:127. \n\n[71] The number of letters, plus the \nnumber  of  words  in  3:78  and  in  the \nfalse  verses  9:128-129,  give  the  same \ntotal,  143.  Verse  3:78  consists  of  27 \nwords  and  116  letters,  &  9:128-129 \nconsist of 115 letters and 28 words. \n\nTable 41: The number of verses \nfrom 3:81 to the end of Sura 9. \n\nSura  No. of \n No.   Verses \n  3 \n  4 \n  5 \n  6 \n  7 \n  8 \n  9 \n            \u2014 \u2014 \u2014   \n\n  119 \n  176 \n  120 \n  165 \n  206 \n   75  \n  127 \n\n  988 \n      (19x52)   \n\nSum of \n     Verse #s \n 16860 \n 15576 \n  7260 \n 13695 \n 21321 \n  2850 \n  8128 \n   \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \n 85690 \n\n    (19x4510) \n\nTable 42: Occurrence of the word \u201cGod\u201d \nfrom 3:78 to the end of Sura 9 \n\n    Sura   \n  Number \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n\n      Frequency of \n     \u201cGod\u201d \n\n132 \n229 \n147 \n 87 \n 61 \n 88 \n168 \n \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 - \n912 \n\n   (19x48) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

Vast  and  ut-      \n\nterly overwhelming as it is, it does not surpass or even match the overall mathe- \nmatical  miracle  of  the  Quran  which  is  detailed  in  Appendix  One.  This  merely \nconfirms  the  fact  that  the  Almighty  Author  of  the  Quran  has  deliberately  per-\nmitted the blasphemous addition of two verses to Sura 9 in order to: \n\n(1)  Demonstrate an essential function of the Quran\u2019s mathematical composi-\ntion. \n(2)  Prove the impossibility of tampering with the Quran. \n(3)  Fulfill  God\u2019s  promise  to  distinguish  the  believers  and  expose  the \nhypocrites. \n\n Why Did God Permit It For 1400 Years?? \nDue  to  the  mass  corruption  of  Islam  shortly  after  the  prophet  Muhammad\u2019s \ndeath, God obviously has fulfilled His pledge in 47:38. A divine decree issued in \nSura 47, which is entitled \u201cMuhammad,\u201d Verse 38 (19x2), stipulates that \u201cif the \nArabs  failed  to  uphold  the  Quran,  God  will  dismiss  them  from  His  grace,  and \nsubstitute other people in their place.\u201d \n\nWhen  the  Arabs  distorted  the  Quran  a  few  years  after  the  Prophet\u2019s  death,   \nand  exterminated  the  Prophet\u2019s  family  in  the  process,  they  incurred  God\u2019s    \npledge  of  47:38,  and  no  longer  deserved  to  possess  the  Quran;  the  true  Quran. \nThe evidence is irrefutable that the Arabs have abandoned the Quran en masse. \n\nFor  example,  there  is  not  a  single  mosque  in  the  so-called  Muslim  world  \ntoday  (1989)  that  upholds  the  crucial  commandment:  \u201cThe  mosques  belong  to \nGod; you shall not invoke anyone else besides God\u201d (72:18). \n\nThe call to prayer  (Azan) and  the prayer itself are  no longer  devoted to  God \n\nalone; Muhammad\u2019s name is invariably invoked along with the name of God. \n\nThe \u201cFirst Pillar of Islam\u201d is clearly stated in the Quran, 3:18 & 47:19, and its \nwords are decreed to be: LAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH (There is no other god \nbesides  God).  But  the  Muslims,  as  early  as  the  first  century  AH,  do  not  want   \nGod  if  Muhammad  is  not  invoked  along  with  Him.  This  is  easily  demonstrable \ntoday by going into any mosque and declaring: \u201cLAA ELAAHA ELLA ALLAH;\u201d \nthis  will  actually  enrage  today\u2019s  Muslims.  This  behavior  is  documented  in  the \nQuran, 39:45. Moreover, my own research has now convinced me that the tradi-\ntional Muslims are forbidden by God from uttering the Quranic, divinely dic- \n\n \n\f"

Test them yourself. The First \nPillar  of  the  distorted  Islam,  LAA  ELAAHA  ELLA  ALLAH,  MUHAMMAD \nRASOOL ALLAH, does not conform with God\u2019s commandments that came to us \nthrough Muhammad (see Appendix 13). \n\nA number of other commandments are violated as well by this Mohammedan \nShahaadah. For example, the Quran enjoins us repeatedly from making any dis-\ntinction  among  God\u2019s  messengers  (2:136,  285;  3:84).  The  distorted  Shahaadah \ngives  more  distinction  to  Muhammad,  against  his  will.  Despite  the  Quran\u2019s \nrepeated assertions that it is \u201ccomplete, perfect, and fully detailed\u201d (6:19, 38, & \n114),  the  \u201cMuslims\u201d  have  refused  to  believe  their  Creator;  they  uphold  such \nridiculous and nonsensical  sources  as Hadith  and Sunna.

We  learn  from  18:7-8  and  69:13-15 \nthat this  world will come to an end. A  new  earth and new heavens will replace   \nthe present heavens and earth (14:48). \n\nSigns of the Approaching End of the World \nThe  Quran  provides  many  signs,  and  states  that  the  means  for  unveiling  the \n\nend of the world have been given (47:18). The signs given in the Quran include: \n\n1.  The splitting of the moon: This already happened in June 1969 when we \nlanded  on  the  moon  and  brought  back  moon  rocks.  People  on  earth  can  go \nnow  to  many  museums,  colleges  and  observatories  to  look  at  pieces  of  the \nmoon. \n2.  Discovering the Quran\u2019s 19-based mathematical code (74:30-37): Fulfilled \nin 1969-1974. \n3.  The creature (27:82): \u201cMade from the earth, it alerts the people that they \nhave  been  oblivious  to  their  Creator.\u201d  The  Creature,  made  from  the  earth,    \ndid  appear  and  was  instrumental  in  unveiling  the  Quran\u2019s  numerical  code,   \nand proclaiming that the world has neglected God\u2019s  message; the creature is \nthe computer. Note that the digits that make up 27:82 add up to 19. \n4.  Appearance  of  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  (3:81):  As  detailed  in \nAppendix 2, a consolidating messenger, prophesied in the Quran, comes after \nall  the  prophets  have  delivered  the  scriptures,  to  purify  and  unify.  This \nprophecy was fulfilled in Ramadan 1408. \n5.  The  Smoke  (44:10):  occurs  after  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  has \ndelivered the unified message and proclaimed Islam (Submission) as the only \nreligion acceptable by God. \n6.  Gog  and  Magog:  they  re-appear,  in  accordance  with  God\u2019s  plan,  in  the  \nyear 1700 AH (2271 AD). Gog and Magog are mentioned in 18:94 and 21:96.        \nIf you count the verses from 18:94 to the end of Sura 18, you find them 17. If \nyou count the verses from 21:96 to the end of Sura 21, you find them also 17. \nThis is the Quran\u2019s sign that Gog and Magog will re-appear in 1700 AH. \n\nIt Will Not Remain Hidden [20:15] \n\nVerse 15 of Sura 20 informs us that the end of the world will be revealed by \nGod before the end of the world, and Sura 15, Verse 87, gives the time for that \nevent: \n\n \n\f"

            "1": "Appendix 25 \n\n467 \n\nWe have given you the seven pairs, and the great Quran.       [ 15:87 ] \n\nThe  seven  pairs  are  the  14  Quranic  Initials.  The  total  gematrical  value  of   \nthese  profound  pillars  of  the  Quran\u2019s  miracle  pinpoints  the  year  of  the  end  of     \nthe world. It is noteworthy that Verse 85 of Sura 15 states: \u201cThe end of the world \nwill surely come to pass.\u201d The next verse, 15:86, tells us that God is the Creator \nof  this  world,  and,  of  course,  He  knows  when  it  will  end.  The  following  verse, \n15:87,  tells  us  when  the  world  will  end.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  gematrical \nvalues  of  \u201cThe  Seven  Pairs\u201d  of  Quranic  Initials  total  1709  (see  also  Table  1  of \nAppendix  1).  According  to  15:87,  the  world  will  survive  for  1709  lunar  years \nfrom  the  time  this  prophecy  is  stated  in  the  Quran.  This  means  that  the  world   \nwill end in the year 1710 AH. This number is a multiple of 19; 1710 = 19x90. \n\n  Table 1: Total Gematrical Value of \u201cThe Seven \n   Pairs\u201d of Quranic Initials. \n\nThe unveiling of this information took place in the year 1400 AH, 309 years \nbefore the prophesied end of the world (1709-1400 = 309). The number 309 is a \nQuranic  number  (18:25),  and  is \nconnected  with  the  end  of  the \nworld  (18:21).  The  peculiar  way  \nof  writing  309  in  18:25,  \u201cThree \nhundred \nnine,\u201d  indicates  that  the  309  are \nlunar  years.  The  difference  be-\ntween  300  solar  years  and  300 \nlunar years is 9 years. \nThe  year  of \n\nincreased \n\nyears, \n\nby   \n\nQuranic  \nInitial \n 1. Q \n 2. N \n 3. S (Saad)   \n 4.

Thus  the  world  ends  \nin  1710  AH,  19x90,  which  coin-\ncides  with  2280  AD,  19x120.  For \nthe  disbelievers  who  do  not  ac- \ncept \nthese  powerful  Quranic \nproofs,  the  end  of  the  world  will \ncome  suddenly  (6:31,  44,  47;  7:95, \n187;  12:107;  21:40,  22:55;  26:202; \n29:53; 39:55; 43:66; and 47:18). \n\nWhile Hadith is forbidden as a source of religious teachings (Appendix 19), it \ncan be a useful source of history. We can derive a lot of information about his-\ntorical  events  and  local  customs  and  traditions  during  the  early  centuries  of  \nIslam.  The  books  of  Hadith  indicate  that  the  Quranic  Initials  were  believed  to \ndetermine  the  life  span  of  the  Muslim  Ummah.  The  classic  exegesis  by  Al-\nBaydaawy  cites  the  following  historical  event  as  a  possible  explanation  of  the \nQuranic  Initials.  The  same  event  is  detailed  in  Al-Suyooty\u2019s  ITQAAN,  First \nPrinting, 1318 AH, Vol 2, Page 10: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f"

By  adding  this  total  of  verse \nnumbers  (1145),  to  the  gematrical  value  of  the  name  \u201cRashad\u201d  (505),  plus  the \ngematrical value of the name \u201cKhalifa\u201d (725), we get 1145 + 505 + 725 = 2375, \n19x125. \n\n[12]  If  we  write  down  these  numbers  next  to  each  other,  i.e.,  the  total  of   \n\nverse  numbers  (1145),  followed  by  the  gematrical  value  of  the  name  \u201cRashad\u201d \n(505), followed by the gematrical value of the name \u201cKhalifa\u201d (725), we also get \na number that is a multiple of 19: 1145505725 = 19x60289775. \n\nSum of Verse Numbers Where the 19 \u201cRashada\u201d Occur.........................= 1145 \nGematrical Value of the Name \u201cRashad\u201d ................................................= 505 \nGematrical Value of the Name \u201cKhalifa\u201d ................................................= 725 \n\n1145 + 505 + 725 = 2375 = 19x125 \n\n1145 505 725 = 1145505725 = 19x60289775 \n*********************** \nAppendix 27 \nWho Is Your God? \nMost  people  are  outraged  upon  hearing  this  question.  \u201cWhat  do  you  mean, \n\u2018Who  is  your  god?\u2019  \u201d  they  ask.  \u201cMy  god  is  the  Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the \nearth.\u201d  And  most  of  these  people  will  be  shocked  to  find  out  that  their \nproclamation  that  their  god  is  the  Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  is  no   \nmore than lip service, and that they are in fact destined for Hell (12:106). \n\nYour god is whoever or whatever occupies your mind most of the time. \n\nYour  god  can  be  your  children  (7:190),  your  spouse  (9:24),  your  business \n(18:35), or your ego (25:43). This is why we note that one of the most important \nand most repeated commandments in the Quran is: \n\nO you who believe, you shall remember God frequently; glorify Him day and \nnight. [33:41] \n\nTo  put  this  commandment  into  practice,  we  must  establish  certain  habits \nwhereby  we  guarantee  that  God  occupies  our  minds  more  than  anything  else.   \nThe Quran helps us establish such soul saving habits: \n\n1.

Salat  helps  us  remember  God  not  only  during  the  few  minutes  of  prayer,       \nbut  also  throughout  the  times  of  anticipation.  At  11:00  AM,  one  may  look  at  his       \nor  her  watch  to  see  if  the  noon  prayer  is  due  yet.  This  act  causes  one  to  think     \nabout God, and one is credited accordingly (20:14). \n\n2. Commemorate  God  before  eating:  Verse  6:121  enjoins  us  to  mention  God\u2019s   \nname  before  we  eat:  \u201cYou  shall  not  eat  from  that  upon  which  God\u2019s  name  has       \nnot been mentioned.\u201d \n\n3. God  Willing  (IN  SHAA  ALLAH):  \u201cYou  shall  not  say,  \u2018I  will  do  this  or  that \ntomorrow,\u2019  without  saying,  \u2018God  willing\u2019  (IN  SHAA  ALLAH).  If  you  forget        \nto  do  this,  then  apologize  and  say,  \u2018May  my  Lord  guide  me  to  do  better  next     \ntime.\u2019  \u201d  [18:24].  This  is  a  direct  commandment  that  we  must  carry  out,  no     \nmatter who we are talking with. \n\n4. God\u2019s  Gift  (MAA  SHAA  ALLAH):  To  invoke  God\u2019s  protection  for  our    \nbeloved  objects\u2014our  children,  our  cars,  our  homes,  etc.\u2014we  are  enjoined  in   \n18:39 to say \u201cMAA SHAA ALLAH\u201d (This is God\u2019s gift). \n\n5. Glorify  God  day  and  night:  When  we  eat  anything,  we  shouldn\u2019t  be  like   \nanimals;  we  must  reflect  on  God\u2019s  creation  of  the  food  we  are  eating\u2014the  \nflavor,  our  enjoyment  due  to  the  senses  God  has  given  us,  the  perfect  packag-      \ning  of  the  banana  or  the  orange,  the  varieties  of  sea  foods  created  by  God,      \netc.\u2014and  glorify  Him  as  we  enjoy  His  provisions.  When  we  see  a  beautiful  \nflower,  or  animal,  or  sunsets,  we  must  glorify  God.  We  must  seize  every  pos-     \nsible opportunity to remember and glorify God, so that God may be our God. \n\n6. First  Utterance:  Make  it  a  habit  to  say:  \u201cIn  the  name  of  God,  Most  Gra-      \ncious,  Most  Merciful.  There  is  no  other  god  besides  God,\u201d  the  moment  you    \nwake  up  every  morning.  If  you  establish  this  good  habit,  this  is  what  you  will    \nutter when you are resurrected.   \n\n*********************** \nAppendix 28 \nMuhammad Wrote God\u2019s Revelations \nWith His Own Hand \n\nThe  first  revelation  was  \u201cRead,\u201d  and  included  the  statement  \u201cGod  teaches  by  \nmeans  of  the  pen\u201d  (96:1-4),  and  the  second  revelation  was  \u201cThe  Pen\u201d  (68:1).     \nThe only function of the pen is to write. \n\nIgnorant  Muslim  scholars  of  the  first  two  centuries  after  the  Quran  could  not \nunderstand  the  Quran\u2019s  challenge  to  produce  anything  like  it.  They  had  no  idea      \nabout  the  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  composition,  and  they  knew  that  many  literary      \ngiants could have composed works comparable to the Quran.

The latest claim came from Taha Hussein, the renowned Egyptian writer. \n\nThe  ignorant  Muslim  scholars  then  decided  to  proclaim  Muhammad  an  il-               \n\nliterate  man!  They  figured  that  this  would  make  the  Quran\u2019s  extraordinary      \nliterary  excellence  truly  miraculous.  The  word  they  relied  on  to  bestow  illiteracy     \nupon  the  Prophet  was  \u201cUMMY.\u201d  Unfortunately  for  those  \u201cscholars,\u201d  this  word    \nclearly  means  \u201cGentile,\u201d  or  one  who  does  not  follow  any  scripture  (Torah,  Injeel,         \nor Quran) [see 2:78, 3:20 & 75, 62:2]; it does NOT mean \u201cilliterate.\u201d \n\nThe Prophet was a successful merchant. The \u201cMuslim scholars\u201d who fabri- \ncated  the  illiteracy  lie  forgot  that  there  were  no  numbers  during  the  Prophet\u2019s       \ntime;  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  were  used  as  numbers.  As  a  merchant  dealing      \nwith  numbers  every  day,  the  Prophet  had  to  know  the  alphabet,  from  one  to              \none-thousand. \n\nThe  Quran  tells  us  that  Muhammad  wrote  down  the  Quran\u2014Muhammad\u2019s \ncontemporaries  are  quoted  as  saying,  \u201cThese  are  tales  from  the  past  that  he      \nwrote  down.  They  are  being  dictated  to  him  day  and  night\u201d  (25:5).  You  cannot \n\u201cdictate\u201d  to  an  illiterate  person.  The  Prophet\u2019s  enemies  who  accuse  him  of  il-    \nliteracy abuse Verse 29:48, which relates specifically to previous scriptures. \n\nOn  the  27th  night  of  Ramadan  13  B.H.  (Before  Hijerah),  Muhammad  the     \nsoul,  the  real  person,  not  the  body,  was  summoned  to  the  highest  universe  and       \nthe  Quran  was  given  to  him  (2:97,  17:1,  44:3,  53:1-18,  97:1-5).  Subsequently,  the \nangel  Gabriel  helped  Muhammad  release  a  few  verses  of  the  Quran  at  a  time,       \nfrom  the  soul  to  Muhammad\u2019s  memory.  The  Prophet  wrote  down  and  memo-      \nrized  the  verses  just  released  into  his  mind.  When  the  Prophet  died,  he  left  the \ncomplete  Quran  written  down  with  his  own  hand  in  the  chronological  order  of \nrevelation,  along  with  specific  instructions  as  to  where  to  place  every  verse.  The \ndivine  instructions  recorded  by  the  Prophet  were  designed  to  put  the  Quran    \ntogether  into  the  final  format  intended  for  God\u2019s  Final  Testament  to  the  world    \n(75:17).  The  early  Muslims  did  not  get  around  to  putting  the  Quran  together       \nuntil  the  time  of  Khalifa  Rashed  \u2018Uthmaan.  A  committee  was  appointed  to  carry       \nout this task. Read Appendix 24 for the details. \n\n******************** \nAppendix 29 \nThe Missing Basmalah \nEvery  sura  in  the  Quran  opens  with  the  statement  \u201cIn  the  name  of  God,  Most \nGracious,  Most  Merciful,\u201d  known  as  the  Basmalah,  with  the  exception  of  Sura  9.     \nThis  conspicuous  absence  of  the  Basmalah  from  Sura  9  has  been  an  intriguing    \nfeature  of  the  Quran  for  14  centuries.  Many  theories  have  been  advanced  to    \nexplain this phenomenon. \n\nNow  we  learn  that  the  missing  Basmalah  plays  a  significant  role  as  [1]  a  sig-\nnificant  constituent  of  the  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  miracle,  and  [2]  a  glaring  sign       \nfrom  the  Most  Gracious,  Most  Merciful,  that  Sura  9  has  been  tampered  with  and      \nmust be purified (Appendix 24).

The following list of factual observa-\ntions illustrate the miraculous features of the missing \nBasmalah: \n\n[1] Since the Basmalah consists of 19 Arabic let-\nters, and prefixes all the suras except one, it can be \nconsidered  the  foundation  upon  which  the  Quran\u2019s \n19-based  code  is  built.  But  the  absence  of  the  Bas-\nmalah from Sura 9 causes the number of this crucial \nopening statement to be 113, a number that does not \nconform  with  the  Quran\u2019s  code.  However,  we  find \nthat  this  deficiency  is  compensated  for  in  Sura  27. \nTwo Basmalahs occur in Sura 27, one as an opener \nand one in Verse 30.

Any abuse of this divine permission incurs severe retribution. Thus, although \npolygamy  is  permitted  by  God,  it  behooves  us  to  examine  our  circumstances \ncarefully before saying that a particular polygamous relationship is permissible. \n\nOur perfect example here is the prophet Muhammad. He was  married to one \nwife,  Khadijah,  until  she  died.  He  had  all  his  children,  except  one,  from  Khadi-\njah. Thus, she and her children enjoyed the Prophet\u2019s full attention for as long as \nshe  was  married  to  him;  twenty-five  years.  For  all  practical  purposes,  Muham-\nmad had one wife\u2014from the age of 25 to 50. During the remaining 13 years of  \nhis life, he  married the aged widows of his friends who left  many  children. The \nchildren  needed  a  complete  home,  with  a  fatherly  figure,  and  the  Prophet  \nprovided  that.  Providing  a  fatherly  figure  for  orphans  is  the  only  specific  cir-\ncumstance in support of polygamy mentioned in the Quran (4:3). \n\nOther  than  marrying  widowed  mothers  of  orphans,  there  were  three  political \nmarriages  in  the  Prophet\u2019s  life.  His  close  friends  Abu  Bakr  and  Omar  insisted   \nthat  he  marry  their  daughters,  Aisha  and  Hafsah,  to  establish  traditional  family \nties  among  them.  The  third  marriage  was  to  Maria  the  Egyptian;  she  was  given   \nto him as a political gesture of friendship from the ruler of Egypt. \n\nThis perfect example tells us that a man must give his full attention and loyal-\nty in marriage to his wife and children in order to raise a happy and wholesome \nfamily. \n\n\f"

Therefore,  unless  we  are  absolutely  sure  that  God\u2019s  law  will  not  be   \nabused,  we  had  better  resist  our  lust  and  stay  away  from  polygamy.  If  the  cir-                  \ncumstances  do  not  dictate  polygamy,  we  had  better  give  our  full  attention  to  one     \nwife  and  one  set  of  children.  The  children\u2019s  psychological  and  social  well-being, \nespecially  in  countries  where  polygamy  is  prohibited,  almost  invariably  dictate \nmonogamy. A few basic criteria must be observed in contemplating polygamy: \n1. It must alleviate pain and suffering and not cause any pain or suffering. \n2. If you have a young family, it is almost certain that polygamy is an abuse. \n3. Polygamy to substitute a younger wife is an abuse of God\u2019s law (4:19). \n\n*********************** \n\nAppendix 31 \nEvolution: Divinely Controlled \nWe learn from the Quran that evolution is a divinely designed fact: \nLife began in water: \n\n\u201cFrom water we initiated all living things.\u201d \n\n(21:30, 24:45) \n\nHumans not descendants of monkeys: \u201cHe started the creation of man from \n\nmud.\u201d (32:7) \n\nMan created from \u201caged\u201d mud:  \u201cI am creating the human being from \n\n\u2018aged\u2019 clay.\u201d (15:28) \n\nEvolution  is  possible  only  within  a  given  species.  For  example,  the  navel \norange  evolved  from  seeded  oranges,  not  from  apples.  The  laws  of  probablity   \npreclude  the  possibility  of  haphazard  evolution  between  species.  A  fish  cannot   \nevolve into a bird; a monkey can never evolve into a human. \n\nProbability Laws Preclude Darwin\u2019s Evolution \nIn  this  computer  age,  we  have  mathematical  laws  that  tell  us  whether  a  cer-      \ntain  event  is  probable  or  not.  If  we  throw  five  numbered  cubes  up  in  the  air  and         \nlet  them  fall  into  a  guided  straight  line,  the  probability  laws  tell  us  the  number  of \npossible  combinations  we  can  get:  1x2x3x4x5  =  120  combinations.  Thus,  the  prob-\nability  of  obtaining  any  combination  is  1  in  120,  or  1/120,  or  0.0086.  This  prob-  \nability  diminishes  fast  when  we  increase  the  number  of  cubes.  If  we  increase    \nthem  by  one,  the  number  of  combinations  becomes  1x2x3x4x5x6  =  720,  and  the \nprobability  of  getting  any  combination  diminishes  to  1/720,  0.0014.  Mathe-\nmaticians,  who  are  very  exacting  scientists,  have  agreed  that  the  probability \ndiminishes to \u201cZero\u201d when we increase the number of cubes to 84.

The  human  gene  contains  30,000,000,000  nucleotides;  1%  of  that  is \n300,000,000. \n\nA fitting quote here is that of Professor Edwin Conklin; he stated: \n\nThe probability of life originating from accident is comparable to the prob-\nability of the Unabridged Dictionary resulting from an explosion in a print-\ning factory. \n\n*********************** \nAppendix 32 \nThe Crucial Age of 40 \nWhat is the age of responsibility? If a child dies at the age of 12, without even \nhearing about God, does this child go to Heaven or Hell? What if the child is 15 \nyears old, or 21, or 25? At what age will the human being be held responsible for \nhis  or  her  beliefs?  This  question  has  puzzled  researchers  of  all  religions  for  a  \nlong time. \n\nThe  Quran  sets  the  age  of  responsibility  at  40;  anyone  who  dies  before  this  \nage  goes  to  Heaven  (46:15).  If  the  person  believed  in  God  and  benefitted  from \nbelief by nourishing and developing the soul (see Appendix 15), he or she goes  \nto the High Heaven. Otherwise, the person goes to the Lower Heaven. \n\nYour first reaction to this piece of information is objection: \u201cWhat if the per-\nson  was  really  bad,  evil,  and  an  atheist,  will  he  go  to  Heaven  if  he  died  before   \nthe age of 40?\u201d This is because you are mean, while God is the Most Merciful. \nOur tendency is to \u201cput them all in Hell.\u201d \n\nPeople who object strongly to this Divine mercy cannot come up with a cut- \noff age of responsibility. They ask questions like, \u201cWhat if the person was really \nwicked?\u201d The answer is, \u201cDoes God know that this person was wicked?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cDoes  God  know  that  this  person  does  not  deserve  to  go  to  Heaven?\u201d  \u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cTherefore, this person will not die before the age of 40.\u201d As simple as that.

The whole nation agreed that he was one of the \nmost vicious criminals in history. So much so that his execution was one of the \nrare  occasions  where  the  opponents  of  capital  punishment  did  not  protest.  On    \nthe  contrary,  many  people  actually  celebrated  his  execution.  Numerous  jour-\nnalists, editorials, and politicians lamented the fact that justice took eleven years \nto execute Ted Bundy. They stated that Bundy should have been executed within \na maximum of six years after his conviction. According to the Quran, this would \nhave been the greatest favor anyone could have done to Bundy. He was 42 years \nold when executed. Had he been executed five years earlier, at the age of 37, he \nwould have gone straight to Heaven, and he did not deserve that. \n\nAs it turns out, Bundy was one of the signs God has given us to confirm that \nanyone  who  dies  before  40  goes  to  Heaven.  Bundy\u2019s  name,  Theodore  Robert \nBundy, consists of 19 letters, and he confessed to killing 19 women just one day \nbefore his execution. There were many other signs from God. \n\nDelivering  this  important  piece  of  information  is  one  of  the  responsibilities \n\ngiven to me as God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant. It is not my personal opinion. \n\nIt  is  noteworthy  that  both  Martin  Luther  King  and  Malcolm  X  were  assas-\n\nsinated just a couple of months before their 40th birthdays. \n\n*********************** \n\nAppendix 33 \nWhy Did God Send A Messenger Now? \nAs  stated  in  3:81,  and  in  Appendix  2,  God  has  sent  a  messenger  to  con-           \n\nsolidate the messages delivered by all the prophets, purify them, and unify them \ninto one religion: Submission. The timing is certainly ripe for fulfillment of this \nimportant prophecy, for the following reasons: \n\n1. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have been corrupted beyond recognition. \n2. All God\u2019s messages have been delivered; the Quran is the Final Testament. \n3. More than 93% of the human  beings destined to live in this world are  yet   \nto come. As illustrated in the Introduction, Page xiv, the people who have lived \non  this  earth  since  Adam  are  only  one-fifteenth  of  the  total  projected  human \npopulation. \n\nJudaism \n\nThe  best illustration  of today\u2019s  corrupted  Judaism  can  be  found  in  the books   \nof  a  famous  Rabbi;  Harold  S.  Kushner.  In  his  best  seller  WHEN  BAD  THINGS \nHAPPEN  TO  GOOD  PEOPLE,  Avon  Books,  1981,  Rabbi  Kushner  states  the \nfollowing: \n\n\f"

This  means  that  they  must  keep  themselves  for  their  spouses \nonly,  and  never  allow  anyone  else  to  touch  them  in  a  sexual  manner \n(23:5-6, 24:30, 33:35, 70:29-30). \n\nToday\u2019s  society  is  replete  with  powerful  temptations.  In  America\u2019s  society  of      \n\nthe  eighties,  even  parents  start  talking  about  boyfriends  for  their  daughters  and \ngirlfriends  for  their  sons.  When  they  reach  their  teens,  many  parents  even  supply     \nbirth  control  means  to  their  children.  An  alarming  percentage  of  teen-agers  are \nsexually  active,  even  though  they  are  not  physiologically  mature,  and  without  any   \nmoral  limitations.  Millions  of  illicit  pregnancies  and  the  tragedies  associated  with  \nthem, plus millions of tragic abortions, happen every month in the USA. \n\nAmong  the  results  of  this  moral  breakdown:  unwanted  and  unsupported   \nchildren,  delinquent  and  irresponsible  fathers,  criminals  who  have  no  regard  for \npeople\u2019s  lives  or  properties,  millions  of  social  misfits,  incurable  genital  herpes, \nincurable  genital  warts,  devastating  syphilis  and  gonorrhea,  dysplasia,  the  killer    \nAIDS, and new diseases never known before. \n\nWhat  most  people  do  not  know  is  that  this  moral  breakdown  costs  them   \ndearly  throughout  their  lives.  For  the  only  law  that  rules  the  world  is  God\u2019s  law,        \nand  these  flagrant  violations  of  God\u2019s  law  cost  them  a  lot  of  misery  and  problems \n(20:124). \n\nThe  true  believers  who  care  about  their  children  will  advise  them  and  remind    \nthem  repeatedly  and  persistently  (20:132)  to  keep  their  chastity.  This  means  stay-        \ning  a  virgin  until  their  wedding  night,  then  staying  loyal  to  one\u2019s  spouse\u2014never \ncommitting  adultery\u2014for  their  own  happiness.  God\u2019s  advice  to  keep  our  chastity, \nbefore  and  after  marriage,  is  for  our  own  good.  God  is  the  one  who  controls  our \nhealth, wealth, and happiness or misery (53:43, 48). \n\n************************** \nAppendix 35 \nDrugs & Alcohol \nThere  is  no  compromise  whatsoever  regarding  illicit  drugs  and  alcoholic \nbeverages;  they  are  called  \u201cabominations  and  the  work  of  Satan\u201d  (5:90).  In  2:219        \nand  5:90,  we  see  that  \u201cintoxicants,  gambling,  the  idols\u2019  altars,  and  games  of    \nchance\u201d  are  strictly  prohibited.

Had  they  observed  the  Torah,  the  Gospel,  and  what  is \nrevealed  herein  from  their  Lord,  they  would  have  enjoyed  provisions  from \nabove  them,  and  from  beneath  their  feet.  Some  of  them  are  righteous,  but \nmost of them are evil doers. \n\n[5:65-66] \n\nIf  only  the  people  of  the  various  communities  believed  and  maintained  a \nrighteous  life,  we  would  have  showered  them  with  blessings  from  the  heaven \nand the earth. \n\n[7:96] \n\nGod is the One who controls your happiness, or misery. \n.... God is the One who makes you rich or poor. \n\n[53:43, 48] \n\nA  nation  that  upholds  God\u2019s  laws  is  guaranteed  prominence  among  the  na-\ntions  of  the  world,  victory,  prosperity,  and  happiness  (10:62-64,  16:97,  24:55, \n41:30-31).  On  the  other  hand,  a  nation  that  violates  God\u2019s  laws  incurs  a  mis-\nerable life (20:124). A nation that upholds God\u2019s laws is guaranteed to be a great \nnation.  This  is  not a  mere  idealistic dream;  since God is in  full  control (10:61), \nHis  guarantees  and  promises  are  done.  A  nation  that  upholds  God\u2019s  laws  is \ncharacterized by: \n\n1.  Maximum  freedom  for  the  people\u2014freedom  of  religion,  freedom  of  ex-\n\npression, freedom to travel, and freedom of economy (2:256, 10:99, 88:21-22). \n\n2. Guaranteed human rights for all the people, regardless of their race, color, \n\ncreed, social status, financial situation, or political affiliation (5:8, 49:13). \n\n3. Prosperity for all the people. God\u2019s economic system is based on constant \ncirculation  of  wealth,  no  usury,  and  productive  investment.  Non-productive \neconomy  such  as  gambling,  lottery,  and  high  interest  loans  are  not  permitted \n(2:275-7, 59:7). \n\n4. Social justice for all. Because of the obligatory charity (Zakat), no one will \n\ngo hungry or un-sheltered (2:215, 70:24-25, 107:1-7). \n\n5. A political system that is based on unanimous consensus. Through mutual \nconsultation and freedom of expression, one side of any given issue convinces all \nparticipants in the discussion. The end result is a unanimous agreement, not the \nopinion of a 51% majority rammed down the throat of the 49% minority (42:38). \n6. A  society  that  upholds  and  maintains  the  highest  standards  of  moral  be-\nhavior.  There  will  be  a  strong  family,  no  alcoholism,  no  illicit  drugs,  no  il-\nlegitimate pregnancies, no abortions, and practically no divorce. \n\n7.

Environmental  protection  is  guaranteed  through  conservation  and  prohibi-\n\ntion of wasteful practices (30:41). \n\n************************** \nAppendix 37 \nCriminal Justice \nIf a thief steals a thousand dollars from you, and they put him in prison, what \ndo you get? If the thief has a wife and children, what is their crime? Why should \nthey be deprived of their father? \n\nThe  Quran  solves  this  problem,  as  well  as  the  problems  associated  with  the \n\ncriminal justice systems prevalent in today\u2019s world. \n\nEquivalence is the Law [2:178-179] \nAccording to the Quranic criminal justice, the thief who is convicted of steal-\ning  a  thousand  dollars  from  you  must  work  for  you  until  you  are  fully  paid  for  \nthe thousand dollars you lost, plus any other damage and inconvenience the theft \nmay  have  caused  you.  At  the  same  time,  the  thief\u2019s  innocent  wife  and  children   \nare  not  deprived  of  their  man,  and  the  expensive  prison  system  is  eliminated. \nImprisonment is a cruel and inhumane punishment that has proven useless to all \nconcerned. \n\nContrary to common belief, the thief\u2019s hand shall not be cut off. Thank God \nfor His mercy and His mathematical miracle in the Quran, we know now that the \nthief\u2019s hand is to be marked. Marking the hand of the thief is stated in 5:38. The \nsura  and  verse  numbers  add  up  to  5  +  38  =  43.  The  other  place  in  the  Quran  \nwhere \u201cthe hand is cut\u201d is found in 12:31. This is where we see the women who \nadmired  Joseph  so  much,  they  \u201ccut\u201d  their  hands.  Obviously,  they  did  not  sever \ntheir  hands;  no  one  can  do  that.  The  sura  and  verse  numbers  add  up  to                \n12 + 31 = 43, the same total as in 5:38. This gives mathematical confirmation that \nthe Quranic law calls for marking the hand of the thief, not severing it. Addition-\nal mathematical confirmation is provided: 19 verses after 12:31, we see the \u201ccut-\nting  of  the  hand\u201d  again.  Punishment  in  Islam  (Submission)  is  based  on \nequivalence and social pressure (2:178, 5:38, 24:2). \n\nThe  blasphemy  called  \u201cHadith  &  Sunna\u201d  has  instituted  stoning  to  death  as   \nthe punishment for married adulterers. This is not God\u2019s law. As stated in 24:2, \nthe punishment for adultery is whipping in public; a hundred symbolic lashes. As \npointed  out  above,  the  basic  punishment  is  social  pressure  and  scandalizing  the \ncriminal. Whipping in public achieves this goal. \n\nIn  dealing  with  murder,  the  Quran  definitely  discourages  capital  punishment \n(2:179).  \u201cThe  free  for  the  free,  the  slave  for  the  slave,  and  the  female  for  the \nfemale\u201d (2:178). Due to human meanness and injustice, many people cannot even \nimagine  what  this  Quranic  law  says.  They  refuse  to  accept  the  clear  injunc-    \ntions that strict equivalence must be observed\u2014if a woman kills a man, or a man \n\n\f"
