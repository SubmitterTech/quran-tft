From  now  to  the  end  of  the  world,  2280  A.D. (Appendix  25), it is estimated that the total world population will exceed 75,000,000,000.

This  challenge  to  God\u2019s  absolute  authority  was  not  only  blasphemous,  it  was  also  erroneous.  Satan  was  ignorant  of  the  fact  that  God  alone possesses  the  ability  to  be  a  god,  and  that  there  is  much  more  to  godhood  than  he realized.  It  was  the  ego\u2014arrogance  augmented  by  ignorance\u2014that  led  Satan  to  believe  that  he  could  take  care  of  a  dominion,  as  a  god,  and  run  it  without  disease, misery,  war, accidents, and  chaos. The  vast  majority  of  God\u2019s  creatures disagreed with Satan. Yet, the minute  egotistic  minority  that  agreed  with  him  to  various  extents were  in  the  billions.  Thus, a profound dispute  erupted  within  the Heavenly Community (38:69). The rebels\u2019 unjustifiable challenge to God\u2019s  absolute  authority  was met and resolved in the most efficient manner. After giving the rebels sufficient chances to denounce their crime and submit to Him, God decided to exile the hard core rebels on a space ship called Earth, and give them yet another chance to redeem themselves.

As for  those  who  agreed  with  Satan,  they were  given  a  chance  to  kill  their  egos  and  submit  to  God\u2019s  absolute  authority.

These egotistic creatures who failed to submit to God’s absolute authority, even when offered a chance to do so, were divided in half. The half that were less convinced of Satan’s point of view became classified as humans. Although they harbored doubts about Satan’s claim, they failed to make a firm stand regarding God’s absolute authority. It is the ego that prevented these creatures from appreciating God’s omnipotence, it is the ego that prevented them from submitting when such an opportunity was offered to them (33:72), and it is the ego that stands between most of us and redemption to God’s kingdom (25:43).

It was God’s plan to assign one jinn to every human being from birth to death. The jinn companion represents Satan and constantly promotes his point of view (50:23, 50:27). Both the jinns and the humans are given a precious chance in this world to re-educate themselves, denounce their egoism, and redeem themselves by submitting to God’s absolute authority. Whenever a human being is born, a jinn is born and is assigned to the new human. We learn from the Quran that the jinns are Satan’s descendants (7:27, 18:50). When a jinn being is born and assigned to a human being, the jinn remains a constant companion of the human until the human dies. The jinn is then freed, and lives on for a few centuries. Both humans and jinns are required to worship God alone (51:56).",

If we keep going, we will reach the border of our Milky Way Galaxy after 50-70,000 years at the speed of light. To reach the nearest galaxy, it will take us 2,000,000 years at the speed of light, and there are at least 2,000,000,000 galaxies in “our universe.” With the most powerful telescopes, the earth is utterly invisible from the edge of our own galaxy, let alone from the edge of our universe. As if our universe were not vast enough, God created six more, even larger universes surrounding our universe (2:29, 67:3). God then informed Satan that a tiny mote within the smallest and innermost universe, the planet Earth, shall be his dominion. God’s plan called for placing the humans and jinns in a universe that cannot stand His physical presence (7:143). Thus, Satan rules his minute kingdom far from the physical presence of God, though with God’s full knowledge and control. It should also be noted that the number of rebels who repented was so vast, that the planet earth could not possibly accommodate all of them. As it is, the animals vastly outnumber the humans on this planet. It would take an unmanagable earth to accommodate all the repentant rebels.

Adam’s mate was cloned, with feminine features, from Adam, and God assigned the second human being to her body. While the empty (soulless) bodies of Adam and Eve remained here on earth, their souls, the real persons, resided in Heaven. Adam and Eve remained in Heaven for as long as they upheld God’s commandments. Once they listened to Satan instead, they reflected a flawed human nature in all of us, and they immediately belonged to Satan’s dominion down on Earth—“their bodies became visible to them” (7:20, 20:121).

As mentioned above, every time a human being is born, a jinn being is born to serve as a constant companion of the human person. Every human being is subjected to the incessant persuasions of Satan’s representative who lives in the same body from birth to death. Satan’s representative tries to convince the human companion of Satan’s point of view: that God alone is not enough. On the Day of Judgment, the jinn companion serves as a witness against the human counterpart (43:38, 50:23, 50:27). Many jinn companions are converted to God’s point of view by the human companions.",

To help the humans in their final chance to reconsider their blasphemy, every person is born with instinctive knowledge that God ALONE, and no one else, is our Lord and Master (7:172-173). The jinns were not given this instinctive knowledge, but they are given a much longer life span and greater abilities to study God’s signs throughout the innermost universe. Since they represent Satan’s point of view, their instinctive nature leans strongly in favor of polytheism. In addition to our built-in instinct to worship God alone, God sent messengers to help us redeem ourselves. With all these elements in view, we can appreciate the fact that the only unforgivable offense (if maintained until death) is idol worship: believing that anyone besides God possesses any power.",

When Moses went to Pharaoh, he was supported by such miracles as the turning of his staff into a serpent. Jesus created live birds from clay by God’s leave, healed the leprous and the blind by God’s leave, and revived the dead by God’s leave. The prophet Muhammad, God’s messenger who delivered this Final Testament, did not exhibit such miracles (10:20). The Quran itself was the miracle supporting Muhammad’s mission (29:50-51). It was divine wisdom that separated the Miracle of the Quran from Muhammad by 14 centuries. Now that we understand the momentous dimensions of the Quran’s mathematical miracle (Appendix 1), we realize that millions of people would have worshiped Muhammad as God incarnate if this Miracle were revealed through him.",

Only a few people witnessed the miracles of Moses and Jesus, but the Quran’s miracle can be witnessed by anyone at any time.
