The main function of God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant is to purify the \nscriptures and unify them into one universal message to this world from the Creator      \nand Sustainer of this world. \n\nThis major scriptural prophecy has now been fulfilled. God\u2019s Messenger of the \nCovenant  has  arrived,  supported  by  overwhelming  tangible  proof  (see  Appendix  \nTwo). The purification and unification process has begun. God\u2019s plan is supported       \nby God\u2019s invisible forces, and the enormous dimensions of this divine plan is manifest       \nin the recent exposure of false religionists, and the removal of such anti-freedom \nbarriers as the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain, and the bamboo curtain. \n\nHenceforth,  there  is  only  one  religion  acceptable  to  God\u2014Submission. \nAnyone who submits to God and devotes the worship to God ALONE is a \u201cSubmit-\nter.\u201d  Thus,  one  may  be  a  Jewish  Submitter,  a  Christian  Submitter,  a  Buddhist          \nSubmitter, a Hindu Submitter, or a Muslim Submitter. \n\nThe only religion acceptable to God is Submission. \n\n      [3:19] \n\nAnyone who seeks other than Submission as his religion, \nit will not be accepted from him and, in the Hereafter, \nhe will be with the losers.

(Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15) \n\nI will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kinsmen, and will put \nMy words into his mouth; he shall tell them all that I command him. If any man \nwill not listen to My words which he speaks in My name, I Myself will make him \nanswer for it.

(Jesus in John 14:16-17) \n\nWhen THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH comes to you, he will guide you to all truth, and \nwill announce to you the things to come.                 (Jesus in John 16:13) \n\nGod\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant \nLo, I am sending My messenger to prepare the way before Me; and suddenly there \nwill come to the temple the Lord whom you seek, and the messenger of the covenant \nwhom you desire. \nYes, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who will endure the day of his coming? \nAnd who can stand when he appears? \nFor he is like the refiner\u2019s fire... he will sit purifying....           (Malachi 3:1-3) \n\nWhen God ALONE is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the \nHereafter shrink with aversion.

(Before Hijra) (610A.D.),                             \n\nthe prophet Muhammad (the soul\u2014the real person\u2014not the body) was                \nsummoned to the highest possible point, millions of light years from the                       \nplanet Earth, and this Quran was placed into his heart (2:185, 17:1,                    \n44:3, 53:1-18, 97:1). \n\nSubsequently, the Quran was released into Muhammad\u2019s memory,                    \n\nwith Gabriel\u2019s mediation, over a period of 23 years, 610 to 632 A.D.             \n(17:106). At the moment of release, Muhammad scrupulously wrote it                  \ndown with his own hand (Appendix 28). What Muhammad left was the              \ncomplete Quran, written in the chronological sequence of revelation,                      \nwith detailed instructions for putting the revelations into the sequence                 \ndecreed by God. \n\nDuring the re-arrangement process, the scribes who idolized the                 \n\nProphet added two verses at the end of Sura 9, the last sura revealed in               \nMedina. This blasphemous act resulted in a 50-year war between Ali \nIbn Abi Taaleb and his supporters on one side and the distorters of the                               \nQuran on the other side. The war ended when Hussein ibn Ali and his                    \nfamily were martyred in Karbala. \n\nIt was the Umayyad ruler Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam (died in 684 AD)                   \nwho destroyed the original Quran that was written by Muhammad\u2019s                    \nhand, \u201cfearing the eruption of new disputes.\u201d \n\nGod\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  has  presented  overwhelming                     \nevidence that 9:128-129 do not belong in the Quran (Appendix 24).                      \nWith  the  removal  of  these  false  verses,  the  Quran  has  finally  been                    \nrestored.  Our  generation  is  the  first  ever  to  receive  the  Quran  in  its                     \npurified and finalized form (see Appendices 1 and 28). \n\n\f"
