In the name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.* \n2.  Praise be to GOD, Lord of the universe. \n3.  Most Gracious, Most Merciful. \n4.  Master of the Day of Judgment. \n5.  You alone we worship. You alone we ask for help. \n6.  Guide us in the right path; \n7.  the path of those whom You blessed; not of those who have deserved wrath, \n\nnor of the strayers. \n\n*1:1 The first verse in the Quran represents the foundation upon which a superhuman \n19-based mathematical miracle is built. This important statement consists of 19 Arabic \nletters, and every word in it occurs in the whole Quran in multiples of 19 (see Appendices \n1 & 29 for the details). \n\n*1:1-7 Sura 1 is God\u2019s gift to us to establish contact with Him through the daily Contact \nPrayers. This fact is supported by an earth-shattering, simple-to-understand-but-impos-\nsible-to-imitate  mathematical  composition  that  challenges  the  greatest  mathematicians \non earth, and stumps them; it is far beyond human capabilities: \n(1) The sura number, followed by the numbers of verses, next to each other, give 1 1 2 \n3 4 5  6 7. This number is a multiple of 19. \n(2) If we substitute the number of letters per verse in place of verse numbers, we get 1 \n19 17 12 11 19 18 43. This number is also a multiple of 19. \n(3) If we insert the total gematrical value of every verse, we get 1 19 786 17 581 12 618 \n11 241 19 836 18 1072 43 6009. This number is a multiple of 19. \n(4)  The  number  shown  above  includes  all  para- \nmeters of Sura 1, and consists of 38 digits (19x2). \n(5) It  is  noteworthy  that  this  38-digit  number  is  still \ndivisible  by  19  when  we  write  its  components  back- \nwards,  from  right  to  left,  as  practiced  by  the  Arabs. \nThus, 6009 43 1072 18 836 19 241 11 618 12 581 17 \n786 19 1 is also a multiple of 19. \n(6) The mathematical representations mentioned \nabove participate in numerous extraordinary math- \nematical phenomena to confirm all details of the five    Totals             139                 10143 \ndaily Contact Prayers (Appendix 15). \n(7) Many more astounding phenomena are given in Appendix One. Thus, the reader \nis handed, at the outset, tangible proof that this is God\u2019s message to the world. \n\nVerse #  No of \nLetters \n19 \n17 \n12 \n11 \n19 \n18 \n43 \n\nGematrical \nValue \n786 \n581 \n618 \n241 \n836 \n1072 \n6009 \n\n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n    6 \n    7 \n\nCumulative frequency of the word GOD= \n2 \n\n     Cumulative sum of verses where GOD occurs= \n 3 \n\n \n\f"

This scripture is infallible; a beacon \n\nfor the righteous; \n\nThree Categories of People     \n\n(1) The Righteous. \n3.  who believe in the unseen, observe \nthe Contact Prayers (Salat),* and \nfrom our** provisions to them, they \ngive to charity. \n\n4.  And they believe in what was reveal-\ned to you, and in what was revealed \nbefore you, and with regard to the \n\nThe Heifer (Al-Baqarah) 2:1-8 \n\nHereafter, they are absolutely cer-\ntain.* \n\n5.  These  are  guided  by  their  Lord; \n\nthese are the winners. \n\n(2) The Disbelievers \n6.  As for those who disbelieve, it is the \nsame for them; whether you warn \nthem, or not warn them, they cannot \nbelieve.* \n\n7.  GOD seals their minds and their \nhearing, and their eyes are veiled. \nThey have incurred severe retribu- \ntion. \n\n(3) The Hypocrites \n8.  Then there are those who say, \u201cWe \nbelieve in GOD and the Last Day,\u201d \nwhile they are not believers. \n\n*2:1 These initials remained a divinely guarded secret for 1400 years. Now we recognize \nthem  as  a  major  component  of  the  Quran\u2019s  extraordinary  mathematical  code  (see \nAppendices  1,  2,  24,  and  26).  The  meaning  of  A.L.M.  is  pointed  out  in  Verse  2:  \u201cThis \nscripture is infallible.\u201d This is incontrovertibly proven by the fact that the frequencies of \noccurrence of these three initials in this sura are 4502, 3202, and 2195, respectively. The \nsum of these numbers is 9899, or 19x521. Thus, these most frequent letters of the Arabic \nlanguage  are  mathematically  placed  according  to  a  super-human  pattern.  These  same \ninitials also prefix Suras 3, 29, 30, 31, and 32, and their frequencies of occurrence add     \nup to multiples of 19 in each one of these suras. \n*2:3  Since  the  Contact  Prayers  are  decreed  five  times  a  day,  they  constitute  the  prime \nsource  of  nourishment  for  our  souls.  Along  with  all  other  practices  in  Submission,  the \nContact Prayers were originally revealed through Abraham (21:73, 22:78). Although these \nfive  daily  prayers  were  practiced  before  the  revelation  of  the  Quran,  each  Contact     \nPrayer is specifically mentioned in the Quran (24:58, 11:114, 17:78, & 2:238). Appen-\ndices 1 & 15 provide physical evidence supporting all the details of the Contact Prayers, \nincluding  the number of units  (Rak\u2018aas)  and  the numbers of  bowings,  prostrations,  and \nTashahhuds in each prayer. \n**2:3  When  God  uses  the  plural  tense,  this  indicates  that  other  entities,  usually  the    \nangels, are involved. When God spoke to Moses, the singular form was used (20:12-14). \nSee Appendix 10. \n*2:4 Despite severe distortions that afflicted the previous scriptures, God\u2019s truth can still  \nbe  found  in  them.  Both  the  Old  Testament  and  the  New  Testament  still  advocate       \nabsolute  devotion to God  ALONE  (Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Mark 12:29-30).  All  distortions \nare easily detectable. \n*2:6-7 Those who make a decision to reject God are helped in that direction; they are \nprevented by God from seeing any proof or guidance for as long as they maintain such \na decision. The consequences of such a disastrous decision are spelled out in Verse 7. \n18 \n4 \n\n \n\f"

In  their  minds  there  is  a  disease. \nConsequently,  GOD  augments  their \ndisease. They have incurred a pain- \nful retribution for their lying. \n\n11.  When they are told, \u201cDo not com- \nmit  evil,\u201d  they  say,  \u201cBut  we  are \nrighteous!\u201d \n\n12.  In fact, they are evildoers, but they \n\ndo not perceive. \n\n13.  When they are told,  \u201cBelieve like \nthe people who believed,\u201d they say, \n\u201cShall we believe like the fools who \nbelieved?\u201d In fact, it is they who are \nfools, but they do not know. \n\n14.  When they meet the believers, they \nsay, \u201cWe believe,\u201d but when alone \nwith their devils, they say, \u201cWe are \nwith you; we were only mocking.\u201d \n15.  GOD mocks them, and leads them \non  in  their  transgressions,  blunder- \ning. \n\n16.  It is they who bought the straying, at \nthe expense of guidance. Such trade \nnever prospers,  nor  do  they  receive \nany guidance. \n\n17.  Their  example  is  like  those  who \nstart a fire, then, as it begins to shed \nlight around them, GOD takes away \ntheir  light,  leaving  them  in  darkness, \nunable to see. \n\n18.  Deaf,  dumb, and blind; they fail to \n\nreturn. \n\n19.  Another  example:  a  rainstorm  from \nthe  sky  in  which  there  is  darkness, \nthunder,  and  lightning.  They  put \ntheir  fingers  in  their  ears,  to  evade \ndeath. GOD is fully aware of the \ndisbelievers. \n\nThe Light of Faith \n\n20.  The  lightning  almost  snatches  away \ntheir  eyesight.  When  it  lights  for \nthem,  they  move  forward,  and  when \nit turns dark, they stand still. If GOD \nwills, He* can take away their hear- \ning and their eyesight. GOD is Om- \nnipotent. \n\n21.  O  people,  worship  only  your  Lord\u2014 \nthe  One  who  created  you  and  those \nbefore you\u2014that you may be saved. \n\n22. The One who made the earth hab- \nitable  for you, and the sky a struc-\nture.  He  sends  down  from  the  sky \nwater, to produce all kinds of fruits \nfor  your  sustenance.  You  shall  not \nset up idols to rival GOD, now that \nyou know. \n\nMathematical Challenge \n\n23.  If  you  have  any  doubt  regarding \nwhat we revealed  to our servant,* \nthen  produce  one  sura  like  these, \nand call upon your own witnesses \nagainst GOD, if you are truthful. \n\nAllegorical Description of Hell \n\n24.  If you cannot do this\u2014and you can \nnever  do  this\u2014then  beware  of  the \nHellfire, whose fuel is people and \nrocks; it awaits the disbelievers. \n\n*2:20 \u201cHe\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d do not necessarily imply natural gender in Arabic (Appendix 4). \n*2:23-24 The Quran\u2019s miraculous mathematical code provides numerous proofs as it \nspells out the name \u201cRashad Khalifa\u201d as God\u2019s servant mentioned here. Some literary \ngiants,  including  Al-Mutanabby  and  Taha  Hussein,  have  answered  the  literary  chal-\nlenge, but they had no awareness of the Quran\u2019s mathematical composition. It is the \nQuran\u2019s  mathematical  code,  revealed  through  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant, \nRashad Khalifa, that is the real challenge\u2014for it can never be imitated.

As for those \nwho believe, they know that it is the \ntruth  from  their  Lord.  As  for  those \nwho disbelieve, they say, \u201cWhat did \nGOD mean by such an allegory?\u201d \nHe  misleads  many  thereby,  and \nguides many thereby. But He never \nmisleads thereby except the wicked, \n27.  who violate GOD\u2019s covenant after \npledging to uphold it, sever what \nGOD has commanded to be joined, \nand  commit  evil.  These  are  the \nlosers. \n\n  The Heifer (Al-Baqarah) 2:25-31 \n\nTwo Deaths and Two Lives   \nfor the Disbelievers* \n\n28. How can you disbelieve in GOD \nwhen you were dead and He gave \nyou life, then He puts you to death, \nthen He brings you back to life, then \nto Him you ultimately return? \n29.

Recall  that  your  Lord  said  to  the \nangels,  \u201cI  am  placing  a  representa- \ntive (a temporary god) on Earth.\u201d \nThey said, \u201cWill You place therein \none who will spread evil therein and \nshed blood, while we sing Your \npraises,  glorify  You,  and  uphold \nYour  absolute  authority?\u201d  He  said, \n\u201cI know what you do not know.\u201d \n\nThe Test Begins \n\n31.  He  taught  Adam  all  the  names* \nthen presented  them to the angels, \nsaying, \u201cGive me the names of these, \nif you are right.\u201d \n\n*2:26 See Appendix 5 for further discussion of Heaven and Hell. \n\n*2:28 The righteous do not really die; they go straight to Heaven. When their interim on \nthis  earth  comes  to  an  end,  the  angels  of  death  simply  invite  them  to  go  to  the  same \nParadise where Adam and Eve once lived (2:154, 3:169, 8:24, 22:58, 16:32, 36:20-27, \n44:56, 89:27-30). Thus, while the righteous experience only the first death following our \noriginal sin,  the unrighteous go through two deaths  (40:11).  At the time of death,  the \ndisbelievers  know  their  miserable  fate  (8:50,  47:27),  then  they  suffer  a  continuous \nnightmare that lasts until Hell is created (40:46, 89:23, Appendix 17). \n\n*2:29 Our universe with its billion galaxies, spanning distances of billions of light years, \nis the smallest and innermost of seven universes (Appendix 6). Please look up 41:10-11. \n\n*2:30-37 These verses answer such crucial questions as: \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d (See \nAppendix 7). \n\n*2:31  These  are  the  names  of  the  animals,  the  automobile,  the  submarine,  the  space \nsatellite, the VCR, and all other objects to be encountered by the human beings on Earth. \n\n18 \n\n234 \n\n \n\f"

We set them up as an example for \ntheir generation, as well as sub-\nsequent  generations,  and  an  en- \nlightenment for the righteous. \n\nThe Heifer* \n\n67.  Moses  said  to  his  people,  \u201cGOD \ncommands you to sacrifice a heifer.\u201d \nThey said, \u201cAre you mocking us?\u201d \nHe said, \u201cGOD forbid, that I should \nbehave like the ignorant ones.\u201d \n68.  They said, \u201cCall upon your Lord to \nshow us which one.\u201d He said, \u201cHe \nsays  that  she  is  a  heifer  that  is \nneither too old, nor too young; of an \nintermediate age. Now, carry out \nwhat you are commanded to do.\u201d \n69.  They said, \u201cCall upon your Lord to \nshow us her color.\u201d He said, \u201cHe \nsays that she is a yellow heifer, bright \ncolored, pleases the beholders.\u201d \n70.  They said, \u201cCall upon your Lord to \nshow us which one. The heifers look \nalike to us and, GOD willing, we will \nbe guided.\u201d \n\n71.  He said, \u201cHe says that she is a heifer \nthat was never humiliated in plow- \ning the land or watering the crops; \nfree from any blemish.\u201d They said, \n\u201cNow you have brought the truth.\u201d \nThey finally sacrificed her, after this \nlengthy reluctance. \n\n*2:67 Although this sura contains important laws and commandments, including the \ncontact prayers, fasting, Hajj pilgrimage, and the laws of marriage, divorce, etc., the \nname given to the sura is \u201cThe Heifer.\u201d This reflects the crucial importance of submis-\nsion  to  God  and  immediate,  unwavering  obedience  to  our  Creator.  Such  submission \nproves  our  belief  in  God\u2019s  omnipotence  and  absolute  authority.  See  also  the  Bible\u2019s    \nBook of Numbers, Chapter 19. \n27 \n\n673 \n\n \n\f"

We said, \u201cStrike (the victim) with \npart (of the heifer).\u201d That is when \nGOD brought the victim back to life, \nand showed you His signs, that you \nmay understand. \n\n74.  Despite  this,  your  hearts  hardened \nlike  rocks, or even harder. For there \nare  rocks  from  which  rivers  gush \nout.  Others  crack  and  release  gentle \nstreams,  and  other  rocks  cringe  out \nof reverence for GOD.  GOD is \nnever unaware of anything you do. \n\nDistorting the Word of God \n\n75.  Do you expect them to believe as \nyou do, when some of them used to \nhear the word of GOD, then distort \nit,  with  full  understanding  thereof, \nand deliberately? \n\nConcealing the \nWord of God \n\n76.  And when they meet the believers, \nthey say, \u201cWe believe,\u201d but when \nthey  get  together  with  each  other, \nthey say, \u201cDo not inform (the be- \nlievers) of the information given to \nyou by GOD, lest you provide them \nwith  support  for  their  argument \nconcerning your Lord. Do you not \nunderstand?\u201d \n\n77.  Do they not know that GOD knows \neverything they conceal, and every-\nthing they declare? \n\n78.  Among them are gentiles who do \nnot know the scripture, except \n\nThe Heifer (Al-Baqarah) 2:72-83 \n\nthrough  hearsay,  then  assume  that \nthey know it. \n\n79.  Therefore, woe to those who distort \nthe  scripture  with  their  own  hands, \nthen say, \u201cThis is what GOD has \nrevealed,\u201d  seeking  a  cheap  material \ngain. Woe to them for such distor- \ntion, and woe to them for their illicit \ngains. \n\nEternity of \nHeaven and Hell* \n\n80.  Some have said, \u201cHell will not touch \nus, except for a limited number of \ndays.\u201d Say, \u201cHave you taken such a \npledge  from  GOD\u2014GOD  never \nbreaks  His  pledge\u2014or,  are  you \nsaying about GOD what you do not \nknow?\u201d \n\n81.  Indeed, those who earn sins and be-\ncome  surrounded by  their  evil work \nwill be the dwellers of Hell; they \nabide in it forever. \n\n82.  As for those who believe, and lead \na righteous life, they will be the \ndwellers of Paradise; they abide in it \nforever. \n\nThe Commandments \n\n83.  We made a covenant with the Chil- \ndren  of  Israel:  \u201cYou  shall  not  wor- \nship except GOD. You shall honor \nyour  parents  and  regard  the  rela- \ntives,  the  orphans,  and  the  poor. \nYou  shall  treat  the  people  amicab- \nly. You shall observe the Contact \nPrayers (Salat) and give the obliga- \ntory charity (Zakat).\u201d But you turn-\ned away, except a few of you, and \nyou became averse. \n\n*2:80-82 It is an established belief among corrupted Muslims that they will suffer in Hell \nonly in proportion to the number of sins they had committed, then they will get out of    \nHell and go to Heaven. They also believe that Muhammad will intercede on their behalf, \nand will take them out of Hell. Such beliefs are contrary to the Quran (Appendix 8). \n\n39 \n\n1362 \n\n \n\f"

Some  of  them \nyou  rejected,  and  some  of  them  you \nkilled. \n\nGOD, as a consequence of their dis-\nbelief,  that  keeps  them  from  believ-\ning, except for a few of them. \n\nThe Quran \nConsummates All Scriptures \n89.

GOD\u2019s \ncondemnation  thus  afflicts  the  dis- \nbelievers. \n\n90.  Miserable  indeed  is  what  they  sold \ntheir  souls  for\u2014rejecting  these \nrevelations  of  GOD  out  of  sheer \nresentment  that  GOD  should  be-\nstow  His  grace  upon  whomever  He \nchooses  from  among  His  servants. \nConsequently,  they  incurred  wrath \nupon  wrath.  The  disbelievers  have \nincurred a humiliating retribution. \n91.  When  they  are  told,  \u201cYou  shall  be- \nlieve  in  these  revelations  of  GOD,\u201d \nthey  say,  \u201cWe  believe  only  in  what \nwas  sent  down  to  us.\u201d  Thus,  they \ndisbelieve  in  subsequent  revela- \ntions,  even  if  it  is  the  truth  from  their \nLord,  and  even  though  it  confirms \nwhat  they  have!  Say,  \u201cWhy  then  did \nyou  kill  GOD\u2019s  prophets,  if  you  were \nbelievers?\u201d \n\nLearning From \nIsrael\u2019s History \n\n            Tragic Statement:                                          \n       \u201cMy mind is made up!\u201d  \n88.

We  have  sent  down  to  you  such \nclear revelations, and only the wick-\ned will reject them. \n\n100.  Is it not a fact that when they make \na covenant and pledge to keep it, \nsome of them always disregard it? In \nfact, most of them do not believe. \n\nDisregarding God\u2019s Scripture \n\n101.  Now that a messenger from GOD \nhas come to them,* and even though \nhe proves and confirms their own \nscripture,  some  followers  of  the \nscripture  (Jews,  Christians,  and \nMuslims) disregard GOD\u2019s scrip- \nture behind their backs, as if they \nnever had any scripture. \n\nWitchcraft Condemned \n\n102.  They pursued what the devils taught \nconcerning Solomon\u2019s kingdom. \nSolomon, however, was not a dis- \nbeliever, but the devils were dis- \nbelievers.  They  taught  the  people \nsorcery, and that which was sent \ndown through the two angels of \nBabel, Haroot and Maroot. These \ntwo did not divulge such knowledge \nwithout pointing out: \u201cThis is a test. \nYou shall not abuse such knowl- \nedge.\u201d But the people used it in such \nevil schemes as the breaking up of \nmarriages.  They  can  never  harm \nanyone against the will of GOD. \nThey thus learn what hurts them, \nnot what benefits them, and they \nknow full well that whoever prac- \ntices witchcraft will have no share in \nthe  Hereafter.

Righteousness  is  not  turning  your \nfaces  towards  the  east  or  the  west. \nRighteous  are  those  who  believe  in \nGOD,  the  Last  Day,  the  angels,  the \nscripture,  and  the  prophets;  and \nthey  give  the  money,  cheerfully, \nto  the  relatives,  the  orphans,  the \nneedy,  the  traveling  alien,  the  beg-\ngars,  and  to  free  the  slaves;  and  they \nobserve  the  Contact  Prayers  (Salat) \nand  give  the  obligatory  charity \n(Zakat);  and  they  keep  their  word \nwhenever  they  make  a  promise;  and \nthey steadfastly persevere in the \n\n17 \n\nface  of  persecution,  hardship,  and \nwar.

This  is  an  alleviation  from  your \nLord  and  mercy.  Anyone  who  trans- \ngresses  beyond  this  incurs  a  painful \nretribution. \n\n179.  Equivalence  is  a  life  saving  law  for \nyou,  O  you  who  possess  intelligence, \nthat you may be righteous. \n\nWrite A Will \n\n180.  It  is  decreed  that  when  death  ap- \nproaches,  you  shall  write  a  will  for \nthe  benefit  of  the  parents  and  rela- \ntives,  equitably.  This  is  a  duty  upon \nthe righteous. \n\n181.  If  anyone  alters  a  will  he  had  heard, \nthe  sin  of  altering  befalls  those  re- \nsponsible  for  such  altering.  GOD  is \nHearer, Knower. \n\n182.  If  one  sees  gross  injustice  or  bias  on \nthe  part  of  a  testator,  and  takes  cor- \nrective  action  to  restore  justice  to \nthe will, he commits no sin. GOD is \nForgiver, Most Merciful. \n\n*2:174-176 Despite their recognition of God\u2019s mathematical miracle in the Quran, the \ncorrupted religious leaders tried for many years to conceal this awesome miracle.

Every  kind  of  excuse  is \nprovided to spare lives, including the life of the murderer. The victim\u2019s kin may find it \nbetter, under certain circumstances, to spare the life of the murderer in exchange for an \nequitable compensation.

O you who believe, fasting is de-\ncreed for you, as it was decreed for \nthose before you, that you may at- \ntain salvation. \n\n184. Specific days (are designated for \nfasting); if one is ill or traveling, an \nequal number of other  days  may  be \nsubstituted.  Those  who  can  fast,  but \nwith  great  difficulty,  may  substitute \nfeeding  one  poor  person  for  each \nday of breaking the fast.

Permitted for you is sexual inter-\ncourse with your wives during the \n\nnights of fasting. They are the keep-\ners of your secrets, and you are the \nkeepers of their secrets. GOD knew \nthat  you  used  to  betray  your  souls, \nand He has redeemed you, and has \npardoned  you.  Henceforth,  you  may \nhave  intercourse  with  them,  seeking \nwhat  GOD  has  permitted  for  you. \nYou  may  eat  and  drink  until  the \nwhite  thread  of  light  becomes  dis-\ntinguishable  from  the  dark  thread  of \nnight  at  dawn.  Then,  you  shall  fast \nuntil  sunset.  Sexual  intercourse  is \nprohibited if you decide to retreat to \nthe  masjid (during  the last ten days of \nRamadan).  These  are  GOD\u2019s  laws;   \nyou  shall  not  transgress  them.  GOD \nthus  clarifies  His  revelations  for  the \npeople,  that  they  may  attain  salva-\ntion. \n\nBribery, Corruption Condemned \n188.

You  shall  ob-\nserve GOD, that you may succeed. \n\n*2:183-187  Like  all  duties  in  Submission,  fasting  was  decreed  through  Abraham  (22:78, \nAppendices  9 &  15).  Prior to revelation of  the Quran, sexual intercourse was  prohibited \nthroughout  the  fasting  period.  This  rule  is  modified  in  2:187  to  allow  intercourse  during      \nthe nights of Ramadan. \n*2:189 The literal Quranic idiom says: \u201cDo not enter the homes through the back doors.\u201d \nThe  question  about  the  phases  of  the  moon  is  an  example  of  beating  around  the  bush;      \nthere were bad ulterior motives behind this question. \n126 \n\n9182 \n\n \n\f"

You  commit  no  error  by  seeking \nprovisions  from  your  Lord  (through \ncommerce).  When  you  file  from \n\u2018Arafaat,  you  shall  commemorate \nGOD  at  the  Sacred  Location  (of \nMuzdalifah).  You  shall  commem- \norate  Him  for  guiding  you;  before \nthis, you had gone astray. \n\n199.  You  shall  file  together,  with  the  rest \nof  the  people  who  file,  and  ask  GOD \nfor  forgiveness.  GOD  is  Forgiver, \nMost Merciful. \n\n200.  Once  you  complete  your  rites,  you \nshall  continue  to  commemorate \nGOD  as  you  commemorate  your \nown  parents,  or  even  better.  Some \npeople  would  say,  \u201cOur  Lord,  give \nus  of  this  world,\u201d  while  having  no \nshare in the Hereafter. \n\n201.  Others  would  say,  \u201cOur  Lord,  grant \nus  righteousness  in  this  world,  and \nrighteousness  in  the  Hereafter,  and \nspare us the retribution of Hell.\u201d \n202.  Each  of  these  will  receive  the  share \nthey  have  earned.  GOD  is  most  effi- \ncient in reckoning. \n\nMena: Last Rites of Hajj \n\n203.  You  shall  commemorate  GOD  for  a \nnumber  of  days  (in  Mena);  whoever \nhastens  to  do  this  in  two  days  com- \nmits  no  sin,  and  whoever  stays \nlonger  commits  no  sin,  so  long  as \nrighteousness  is  maintained.  You \nshall  observe  GOD,  and  know  that \nbefore Him you will be gathered. \n\nAppearances May Be Deceiving \n\n204.  Among  the  people,  one  may  im- \npress you with his utterances con- \n\ncerning  this  life,  and  may  even  call \nupon  GOD  to  witness  his  innermost \nthoughts,  while  he  is  a  most  ardent \nopponent. \n\n205.  As  soon  as  he  leaves,  he  roams  the \nearth  corruptingly,  destroying  prop- \nerties  and  lives.  GOD  does  not  love \ncorruption. \n\n206.  When  he  is  told,  \u201cObserve  GOD,\u201d \nhe  becomes  arrogantly  indignant. \nConsequently,  his  only  destiny  is \nHell; what a miserable abode. \n207.  Then  there  are  those  who  dedicate \ntheir  lives  to  serving  GOD;  GOD  is \ncompassionate  towards  such  wor- \nshipers. \n\n208.  O  you  who  believe,  you  shall  em- \nbrace  total  submission;  do  not  fol- \nlow the steps of Satan, for he is your \nmost ardent enemy. \n\n209.  If  you  backslide,  after  the  clear \nproofs  have  come  to  you,  then  know \nthat GOD is Almighty, Most Wise. \n210.  Are  they  waiting  until  GOD  Himself \ncomes  to  them  in  dense  clouds, \ntogether  with  the  angels?  When  this \nhappens,  the  whole  matter  will  be \nterminated,  and  to  GOD  everything \nwill be returned.* \n\nMiracles Bring Greater \nResponsibility* \n\n211.  Ask  the  Children  of  Israel  how \nmany  profound  miracles  have  we \nshown  them!  For  those  who  dis- \nregard  the  blessings  bestowed  upon \nthem by GOD, GOD is most strict in \nretribution. \n\n*2:210 This world is a test; it is our last chance to restore ourselves back into God\u2019s \nkingdom  by  denouncing  idol  worship  (see  the  INTRODUCTION).  If  God  and  His \nangels show up, everyone will believe, and the test will no longer be valid. \n\n*2:211  The  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  miracle  is  a  great  blessing,  and  brings  with  it  an \nawesome responsibility (please see 5:115). \n155 \n\n12993 \n\n \n\f"

Do  you  expect  to  enter  Paradise \nwithout  being  tested  like  those \nbefore you? They were tested with \nhardship and adversity, and were \nshaken up, until the messenger and \nthose who believed with him said, \n\u201cWhere is GOD\u2019s victory?\u201d GOD\u2019s \nvictory is near. \n\nRecipients of Charity \n\n215.

They  ask  you  about  the  Sacred \nMonths  and  fighting  therein:  say, \n\u201cFighting  therein  is  a  sacrilege. \nHowever, repelling from the path of \nGOD and disbelieving in Him and in \nthe sanctity of the Sacred Masjid, \nand evicting its people, are greater \nsacrileges in the sight of GOD. Op- \npression  is  worse  than  murder.\u201d \nThey will always fight you to revert \nyou from your religion, if they can. \nThose among you who revert from \ntheir  religion,  and  die  as  disbe- \nlievers, have nullified their works in \nthis life and the Hereafter. These \nare the dwellers of Hell, wherein \nthey abide forever. \n\n218.

(In case of \npregnancy), the husband\u2019s wishes \nshall supersede the wife\u2019s wishes, if \nhe wants to remarry her. The wom- \nen have rights, as well as obligations, \nequitably.

It is \nnot lawful for the husband to take \nback  anything  he had  given her. \nHowever, the couple may fear that \nthey may transgress GOD\u2019s law. If \nthere is fear that they may transgress \nGOD\u2019s law, they commit no error if \nthe wife willingly gives back what-\never she chooses. These are GOD\u2019s \nlaws; do not transgress them.

If you divorce the women, once they \nfulfill their interim (three menstrua- \ntions), you shall allow them to live in \nthe same home amicably, or let them \nleave amicably. Do not force them \nto stay against their will, as a re- \n\n23 \n\nvenge.  Anyone  who  does  this \nwrongs  his  own  soul.  Do  not  take \nGOD\u2019s revelations in vain. Remem-\nber GOD\u2019s blessings upon you, and \nthat He sent down to you the scrip-\nture and wisdom to enlighten you. \nYou shall observe GOD, and know \nthat GOD is aware of all things. \n232.  If you divorce the women, once they \nfulfill their interim, do not prevent \nthem  from  remarrying  their  hus- \nbands, if they reconcile amicably. \nThis  shall  be  heeded  by  those \namong you who believe in GOD and \nthe Last Day. This is purer for you, \nand more righteous. GOD knows, \nwhile you do not know. \n\n233.  Divorced  mothers  shall nurse their \ninfants two full years, if the father so \nwishes.

Have you noted the one who argued \nwith  Abraham  about  his  Lord, \nthough GOD had given him king-\nship?  Abraham  said,  \u201cMy  Lord \ngrants life and death.\u201d He said, \u201cI \ngrant  life and death.\u201d  Abraham \nsaid, \u201cGOD brings the sun from the \neast, can you bring it  from the \nwest?\u201d The disbeliever was stump-\ned. GOD does not guide the wicked. \n\n*2:252  In keeping  with  the mathematical  composition of  the  Quran, God has  willed \nthat  the name of the messenger  mentioned here shall be  spelled out  mathematically. \nThe discovery of the Quran\u2019s miraculous 19-based code has been divinely reserved for \nGod\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant. By adding this verse number (252), plus the gematri-\ncal value of \u201cRashad\u201d (505), plus the gematrical value of \u201cKhalifa\u201d (725) we get \n252 + 505 + 725 = 1482, or 19x78.

Consider the one who passed by a \nghost town and wondered, \u201cHow \ncan GOD revive this after it had \ndied?\u201d GOD then put him to death \nfor a hundred years, then resur- \nrected him. He said, \u201cHow long \nhave you stayed here?\u201d He said, \u201cI \nhave been here a day, or part of the \nday.\u201d He said, \u201cNo! You have been \nhere a hundred years. Yet, look at \nyour food and drink; they did not \nspoil.  Look  at  your  donkey\u2014we \nthus render you a lesson for the \npeople. Now, note how we construct \nthe bones, then cover them with \nflesh.\u201d When he realized what had \nhappened, he said, \u201cNow I know \nthat GOD is Omnipotent.\u201d \n\nEvery Believer Needs Assurance \n\n260.  Abraham said, \u201cMy Lord, show me \nhow You revive the dead.\u201d He said, \n\u201cDo you not believe?\u201d He said, \n\u201cYes, but I wish to reassure my \nheart.\u201d He said, \u201cTake four birds, \nstudy their marks, place a piece of \neach bird on top of a hill, then call \nthem to you. They will come to you \nin a hurry. You should know that \nGOD is Almighty, Most Wise.\u201d \n\nThe Best Investment \n\n261.  The example of those who spend \ntheir monies in the cause of GOD is \nthat of a grain that produces seven \nspikes, with a hundred grains in \neach  spike.  GOD  multiplies  this \nmanifold for whomever He wills. \nGOD is Bounteous, Knower. \n\n262.  Those who spend their money in the \ncause of GOD, then do not follow \ntheir charity with insult or harm, will \nreceive their recompense from their \nLord; they have nothing to fear, nor \nwill they grieve. \n\n263.  Kind  words  and  compassion  are \nbetter than a charity that is followed \nby insult. GOD is Rich, Clement. \n264.  O you who believe, do not nullify \nyour charities by inflicting reproach \nand insult, like one who spends his \nmoney to show off, while disbeliev- \ning in GOD and the Last Day. His \nexample is like a rock covered with \na thin layer of soil; as soon as heavy \nrain falls, it washes off the soil, leav- \ning it a useless rock. They gain noth- \ning from their efforts. GOD does not \nguide disbelieving people. \n\nCharity \n\n265.  The example of those who give their \nmoney seeking GOD\u2019s pleasure, out \nof sincere conviction, is that of a \ngarden on high fertile soil; when \nheavy rain falls, it gives twice as \nmuch crop. If heavy rain is not avail-\nable, a drizzle will suffice. GOD is \nSeer of everything you do. \n\n266.  Does any of you wish to own a gar-\nden of palm trees and grapes, with \nflowing  streams  and  generous \ncrops, then, just as he grows old, and \nwhile his children are still depend- \nent on him, a holocaust strikes and \nburns  up  his  garden?  GOD  thus \nclarifies the revelations for you, that \nyou may reflect. \n\n*2:259 The lesson we learn here is that the period of death\u2014only the unrighteous die; \nthe righteous go straight to Heaven\u2014passes like one day (see 18:19-25 and Appendix \n17). \n\n255 \n\n24909 \n\n \n\f"

O you who believe, you shall give to \ncharity from the good things you \nearn, and from what we have pro-\nduced for you from the earth. Do \nnot pick out the bad therein to give \naway, when you yourselves do not \naccept it unless your eyes are closed. \nYou should know that GOD is Rich, \nPraiseworthy. \n\n268.  The devil promises you poverty and \ncommands you to commit evil, while \nGOD  promises  you  forgiveness \nfrom Him and grace. GOD is Boun- \nteous, Omniscient. \n\nWisdom: A Great Treasure \n\n269.  He bestows wisdom upon whom-\never He chooses, and whoever at- \ntains wisdom, has attained a great \nbounty. Only those who possess in- \ntelligence will take heed. \n\nAnonymous Charity Better \n\n270.  Any charity you give, or a charitable \npledge you fulfill, GOD is fully \naware thereof. As for the wicked, \nthey will have no helpers. \n\n271.  If you declare your charities, they \nare still good. But if you keep them \nanonymous, and give them to the \npoor, it is better for you, and remits \nmore of your sins. GOD is fully Cog-\nnizant of everything you do. \n\nGod is the Only One Who Guides \n\n272.  You are not responsible for guiding \nanyone. GOD is the only one who \nguides whoever chooses (to be guid- \n\ned). Any charity you give is for your \nown good. Any charity you give shall \nbe for the sake of GOD. Any charity \nyou  give  will  be  repaid  to  you, \nwithout the least injustice. \n\n273.  Charity shall go to the poor who are \nsuffering in the cause of GOD, and \ncannot emigrate. The unaware may \nthink that they are rich, due to their \ndignity. But you can recognize them \nby certain signs; they never beg from \nthe  people  persistently.  Whatever \ncharity you give, GOD is fully aware \nthereof. \n\n274.  Those who give to charity night and \nday, secretly and publicly, receive \ntheir recompense from their Lord; \nthey will have nothing to fear, nor \nwill they grieve. \n\nUsury Prohibited* \n\n275.  Those who charge usury are in the \nsame position as those controlled by \nthe devil\u2019s influence. This is because \nthey claim that usury is the same as \ncommerce. However, GOD permits \ncommerce,  and  prohibits  usury. \nThus,  whoever  heeds  this  com- \nmandment  from  his  Lord,  and \nrefrains from usury, he may keep his \npast  earnings,  and  his  judgment \nrests with GOD. As for those who \npersist in usury, they incur Hell, \nwherein they abide forever. \n\n276.  GOD condemns usury, and blesses \ncharities. GOD dislikes every dis- \nbeliever, guilty. \n\n*2:275-278  It  is an established economic principle that excessive interest on  loans can \nutterly  destroy  a  whole  country.  During  the  last  few  years  we  have  witnessed  the \ndevastation  of  the  economies  of  many  nations  where  excessive  interest  is  charged. \nNormal interest\u2014less than 20%\u2014where no one is victimized and everyone is satisfied, is \nnot usury. \n\n268 \n\n 27081 \n\n\f"

Those who believe and lead a right-\neous life, and observe the Contact \nPrayers (Salat), and give the oblig-\natory  charity  (Zakat),  they  receive \ntheir recompense from their Lord; \nthey will have nothing to fear, nor \nwill they grieve. \n\n278.  O you who believe, you shall ob-\nserve GOD and refrain from all \nkinds of usury, if you are believers. \n279.  If you do not, then expect a war from \nGOD and His messenger. But if you \nrepent, you may keep your capitals, \nwithout inflicting injustice, or incur-\nring injustice. \n\n280.  If the debtor is unable to pay, wait \nfor a better time. If you give up the \nloan as a charity, it would be better \nfor you, if you only knew. \n\n281.  Beware of the day when you are \nreturned to GOD, and every soul is \npaid for everything it had done, \nwithout the least injustice. \n\nWrite Down Financial Transactions \n282.  O you who believe, when you trans-\nact a loan for any period, you shall \nwrite it down. An impartial scribe \nshall do the writing. No scribe shall \nrefuse to perform this service, ac-\ncording to GOD\u2019s teachings. He \nshall write, while the debtor dictates \nthe terms. He shall observe GOD his \nLord and never cheat. If the debtor \nis mentally incapable, or helpless, or \ncannot dictate, his guardian shall \ndictate equitably. Two men shall \nserve as witnesses; if not two men, \n\n29 \n\nthen a man and two women whose \ntestimony  is  acceptable  to  all.* \nThus,  if  one  woman  becomes  bi-\nased, the other will remind her. It is \nthe  obligation  of  the  witnesses  to \ntestify when called upon to do so. \nDo not tire of writing the details, no \nmatter how long, including the time \nof  repayment.  This  is  equitable  in \nthe sight of GOD, assures better wit-\nnessing, and eliminates any doubts \nyou may have. Business transactions \nthat  you execute  on  the  spot need \nnot be recorded, but have them wit-\nnessed. No scribe or witness shall be \nharmed on account of his services. \nIf you harm them, it would be wick-\nedness on your part. You shall ob-\nserve  GOD,  and  GOD  will  teach \nyou. GOD is Omniscient. \n\n283.  If you are traveling, and no scribe is \navailable, a bond shall be posted to \nguarantee repayment. If one is trust-\ned in this manner, he shall return the \nbond when due, and he shall ob-\nserve GOD his Lord. Do not with-\nhold any testimony by concealing \nwhat you had witnessed. Anyone \nwho withholds a testimony is sinful \nat heart. GOD is fully aware of \neverything you do. \n\n284.  To GOD belongs everything in the \nheavens and the earth. Whether you \ndeclare your innermost thoughts, or \nkeep them hidden, GOD holds you \nresponsible for them. He forgives \nwhomever He wills, and punishes \nwhomever He wills. GOD is Omni-\npotent. \n\n*2:282 Financial transactions are the ONLY situations where two women may sub-\nstitute for one man as witness. This is to guard against the real possibility that one witness \nmay marry the other witness, and thus cause her to be biased. It is a recognized fact that \nwomen are more emotionally vulnerable than men. \n\n282 \n\n28768 \n\n\f"

Nothing is hidden from GOD, on \n\nearth, or in the heaven. \n\n6.  He is the One who shapes you in the \nwombs as He wills. There is no other \ngod  besides  Him;  the  Almighty, \nMost Wise. \n\n7.  He sent down to you this scripture, \ncontaining  straightforward  verses\u2014 \nwhich constitute the essence of the \nscripture\u2014as  well  as  multiple- \nmeaning  or  allegorical  verses. \nThose who harbor doubts in their \nhearts  will  pursue  the  multiple- \nmeaning verses to create confusion, \nand to extricate a certain meaning. \nNone  knows  the  true  meaning \nthereof except GOD and those well \nfounded in knowledge.

These are the \n\nThe Most Important \nCommandment* \n\n18.  GOD  bears  witness  that  there  is  no \ngod except He, and so do the angels \nand  those  who  possess  knowledge. \nTruthfully  and  equitably,  He  is  the \nabsolute  god;  there  is  no  god  but \nHe, the Almighty, Most Wise. \n\nSubmission:        \n\nThe Only Religion \n\n19.

For  such \nrejectors  of  GOD\u2019s  revelations, \nGOD is most strict in reckoning. \n\n*3:18 The proclamation of faith (Shahaadah) that is decreed by God is: \u201cThere is no \ngod  except  God,\u201d  in  Arabic  \u201cLa  Elaaha  Ella  Allah\u201d  (see  also  37:35,  47:19).  The \ncorrupted  Muslims  insist  upon  adding  a  second  \u201cShahaadah\u201d  proclaiming  that \nMuhammad is God\u2019s messenger.

When- \never  Zachariah  entered  her  sanc- \ntuary  he  found  provisions  with  her. \nHe  would  ask,  \u201cMary,  where  did  you \nget  this  from?\u201d  She  would  say,  \u201cIt \nis  from  GOD.  GOD  provides  for \nwhomever  He  chooses,  without \nlimits.\u201d \n\nThe Birth of John \n38.

He  has \nchosen you from all the women. \n43.  \u201cO  Mary,  you  shall  submit  to  your \nLord,  and  prostrate  and  bow  down \nwith those who bow down.\u201d \n\n44.

He  will  be \nprominent  in  this  life  and  in  the \nHereafter,  and  one  of  those  closest \nto Me.\u2019 \n\n46.  \u201cHe  will  speak  to  the  people  from \nthe  crib,  as  well  as  an  adult;  he  will \nbe one of the righteous.\u201d \n\n47.

As a messenger to the Children of \nIsrael: \u201cI come to you with a sign \nfrom  your  Lord\u2014I  create  for  you \nfrom clay the shape of a bird, then I \nblow into it, and it becomes a live \nbird by GOD\u2019s leave. I restore vision \nto the blind, heal the leprous, and I \nrevive the dead by GOD\u2019s leave. I \ncan tell you what you eat, and what \nyou store in your homes. This should \nbe a proof for you, if you are be- \nlievers. \n\n50.  \u201cI  confirm  previous  scripture\u2014the \nTorah\u2014and  I  revoke  certain  prohi- \nbitions imposed upon you. I come to \nyou with sufficient proof from your \nLord. Therefore, you shall observe \nGOD, and obey me. \n\n51.  \u201cGOD is my Lord and your Lord;* \nyou shall worship Him alone. This is \nthe right path.\u201d \n\n52.  When Jesus sensed their disbelief, \nhe said, \u201cWho are my supporters \ntowards GOD?\u201d The disciples said, \n\u201cWe are GOD\u2019s supporters; we be- \nlieve in GOD, and bear witness that \nwe are submitters. \n\n53.  \u201cOur  Lord,  we  have  believed  in \nwhat You have sent down, and we \nhave followed the messenger; count \nus among the witnesses.\u201d \n\nThe Death of Jesus* \n54.  They plotted and schemed, but so \ndid  GOD,  and  GOD  is  the  best \nschemer. \n\n55.  Thus, GOD said, \u201cO Jesus, I am \nterminating your life, raising you to \nMe,  and ridding you of the dis- \nbelievers. I will exalt those who fol- \nlow you above those who disbelieve, \ntill the Day of Resurrection. Then to \nMe is the ultimate destiny of all of \nyou, then I will judge among you \nregarding your disputes. \n\n56.  \u201cAs for those who disbelieve, I will \ncommit them to painful retribution \nin this world, and in the Hereafter. \nThey will have no helpers.\u201d \n\n57.  As for those who believe and lead a \nrighteous life, He will fully recom- \npense them. GOD does not love the \nunjust. \n\n58.  These are the revelations that we \nrecite to you, providing a message \nfull of wisdom. \n\nMathematical Confirmation* \n59.  The example of Jesus, as far as GOD \nis concerned, is the same as that of \nAdam; He created him from dust, \nthen said to him, \u201cBe,\u201d and he was. \n60.  This is the truth from your Lord; do \n\nnot harbor any doubts. \n\n*3:51 This is precisely what Jesus is quoted to say throughout the New Testament. See  \nfor example the Gospel of John 20:17, and the book \u201cJesus: Myths and Message\u201d by   \nLisa Spray, Ch. 4 (Universal Unity, Fremont, California, 1992). \n*3:54-55 We learn that Jesus\u2019 soul, the real person, was raised, i.e., Jesus\u2019 life on earth   \nwas terminated, prior to the arrest, torture, and crucifixion of his empty, soulless, but \nphysiologically living body (See the details in Appendix 22). \n*3:59 The \u201cequality\u201d of the creation of Jesus and Adam is confirmed mathematically; \nJesus and Adam are mentioned in the Quran the same number of times, 25 times each. \n\n341 \n\n                                            30460\n\n \n\f"

You have argued about things you \nknew;  why  do  you  argue  about \nthings  you  do  not  know?  GOD \nknows, while you do not know. \n67.

Some followers of the scripture can \nbe trusted with a whole lot, and they \nwill give it back to you. Others \namong them cannot be trusted with \na single dinar; they will not repay \nyou unless you keep after them. \nThat is because they say, \u201cWe do not \nhave to be honest when dealing with \nthe gentiles!\u201d* Thus, they attribute \nlies to GOD, knowingly. \n\n76.  Indeed, those who fulfill their ob- \nligations and lead a righteous life, \nGOD loves the righteous. \n\n77.  As for those who trade away GOD\u2019s \ncovenant, and their obligations, for \na cheap price, they receive no share \nin the Hereafter.

Thus, they utter lies and at-\ntribute them to GOD, knowingly. \n79.

GOD took a covenant from the \nprophets, saying, \u201cI will give you the \nscripture and wisdom. Afterwards, \na messenger will come to confirm all \nexisting scriptures. You shall be- \nlieve in him and support him.\u201d He \nsaid, \u201cDo you agree with this, and \npledge to fulfill this covenant?\u201d \nThey said, \u201cWe agree.\u201d He said, \n\u201cYou have thus borne witness, and \nI bear witness along with you.\u201d \n\n*3:75  Prior  to  the  discovery  of  the  Quran\u2019s  mathematical  code,  some  scholars  falsely \nclaimed that Muhammad was an illiterate man who could not write such a great book. \nThey distorted the meaning of the word \u201cUmmy,\u201d claiming that it meant \u201cilliterate.\u201d \nThis verse proves that \u201cUmmiyyeen\u201d means \u201cgentiles\u201d (See also 62:2 & Appendix 28). \n*3:81 This major prophecy has now been fulfilled. God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant, \nas prophesied in this verse and in the Bible\u2019s Malachi 3:1-21, Luke 17:22-36 & Matthew \n24:27,  is  to  purify  and  unify  God\u2019s  messages  which  were  delivered  by  God\u2019s  prophets. \nJudaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc., have been severely corrupted. \nIt  is  the  will  of  Almighty  God  to  purify  them  and  unify  them  under  the  banner  of \nworshiping Him alone.

Anyone  who  accepts  other  than \nSubmission  as  his  religion,  it  will  not \nbe  accepted  from  him,  and  in  the \nHereafter, he will be with the losers. \n86.  Why  should  GOD  guide  people  who \ndisbelieved  after  believing,  and \nafter  witnessing  that  the  messenger \nis  truth,  and  after  solid  proofs*  have \nbeen  given  to  them?  GOD  does not \nguide the wicked. \n\n88.  Eternally  they  abide  therein;  the \nretribution  is  never  commuted  for \nthem, nor will they be reprieved. \n89.  Exempted  are  those  who  repent \nthereafter,  and  reform.  GOD  is  For- \ngiver, Most Merciful. \n\n When Repentance       \nis Unacceptable \n\n90.  Those  who  disbelieve  after  believ- \ning,  then  plunge  deeper  into  dis- \nbelief,  their  repentance  will  not  be \naccepted  from  them;  they  are  the \nreal strayers. \n\n91.  Those  who  disbelieve  and  die  as  dis- \nbelievers,  an  earthful  of  gold  will  not \nbe  accepted  from  any  of  them,  even \nif  such  a  ransom  were  possible.  They \nhave  incurred  painful  retribution; \nthey will have no helpers. \n\n92.  You  cannot  attain  righteousness \nuntil  you  give  to  charity  from  the \npossessions  you  love.  Whatever  you \ngive  to  charity,  GOD  is  fully  aware \nthereof. \n\nDo  Not  Prohibit \nWhat Is Lawful \n\n93.  All  food  used  to  be  lawful  for  the \nChildren  of  Israel,  until  Israel  im- \nposed  certain  prohibitions  on  them-\nselves  before  the  Torah  was  sent \ndown.

Those  who  fabricate  false  prohibi- \ntions  after  this,  and  attribute  them \nto GOD, are truly wicked. \n\n*3:86 Verses 3:82-90 inform us that those who reject God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant  \nare no longer submitters (Muslims), since they no longer believe the Quran.

GOD  has  granted  you  victory  at \nBadr,  despite  your  weakness. \nTherefore,  you  shall  observe  GOD, \nto show your appreciation. \n\nGod\u2019s Angels     \nHelp the Believers \n\n124.  You  told  the  believers,  \u201cIs  it  not \nenough  that  your  Lord  supports  you \nwith  three  thousand  angels,  sent \ndown?\u201d \n\n125.  Indeed,  if  you  steadfastly  persevere \nand  maintain  righteousness,  then \nthey  attack  you  suddenly,  your  Lord \nwill  support  you  with  five  thousand* \nangels, well trained. \n\n126.

He  thus  annihilates  some  disbe- \nlievers,  or  neutralizes  them;  they  al-\nways end up the losers. \n\n128.  It  is  not  up  to  you;  He  may  redeem \nthem,  or  He  may  punish  them  for \ntheir transgressions. \n\n129.  To  GOD  belongs  everything  in  the \nheavens  and  the  earth.  He  forgives \nwhomever  He  wills,  and  punishes \nwhomever  He  wills.  GOD  is  For- \ngiver, Most Merciful. \n\nUsury Prohibited* \n\n130.  O  you  who  believe,  you  shall  not \ntake  usury,  compounded  over  and \nover.  Observe  GOD,  that  you  may \nsucceed. \n\n131.  Beware  of  the  hellfire  that  awaits \n\nthe disbelievers. \n\n132.  You  shall  obey  GOD  and  the  mes- \nsenger, that you may attain mercy. \n\nAttributes of the Righteous \n\n133.

They \nare  suppressors  of  anger,  and  par- \ndoners of the people. GOD loves the \ncharitable. \n\n135.  If  they  fall  in  sin  or  wrong  their \nsouls,  they  remember  GOD  and  ask \nforgiveness  for  their  sins\u2014and  who \nforgives  the  sins  except  GOD\u2014and \nthey  do  not  persist  in  sins,  knowing-  \nly. \n\n136.  Their  recompense  is  forgiveness \nfrom  their  Lord,  and  gardens  with \nflowing  streams;  they  abide  therein \nforever.  What  a  blessed  reward  for \nthe workers! \n\nVictory for the Righteous \n\n137.

You shall not waver, nor shall you \ngrieve, for you are the ultimate vic- \ntors, if you are believers. \n\n140.  If you suffer hardship, the enemy \nalso suffers the same hardship. We \nalternate the days of victory and \ndefeat among the people. GOD thus \ndistinguishes the true believers, and \nblesses some of you with martyr-\ndom. GOD dislikes injustice. \n141.  GOD thus toughens those who be- \nlieve  and  humiliates  the  disbe- \nlievers. \n\nOur Claims Must Be Tested \n\n142.  Do  you expect  to enter  Paradise \nwithout GOD distinguishing those \namong you who strive, and without \ndistinguishing those who are stead-\nfast? \n\n143.  You used to long for death before \nyou had to face it. Now you have \nfaced it, right before your eyes. \n144.  Muhammad  was  no  more  than  a \nmessenger  like  the  messengers \nbefore him. Should he die or get \nkilled, would you turn back on your \nheels? Anyone who turns back on \nhis heels, does not hurt GOD in the \nleast. GOD rewards those who are \nappreciative. \n\nTime of Death Predetermined \n\n145.  No one dies except by GOD\u2019s leave, \nat a predetermined time. Whoever \nseeks the vanities of this world, we \ngive him therefrom, and whoever \nseeks the rewards of the Hereafter, \nwe bless him therein. We reward \nthose who are appreciative. \n\n146.  Many a prophet had godly people \nfight along with him, without ever \nwavering  under  pressure  in  the \ncause of GOD, nor did they hesitate \nor become discouraged. GOD loves \nthe steadfast. \n\n147.  Their  only  utterance  was,  \u201cOur \nLord, forgive us our sins, and our \ntransgressions,  strengthen our  foot-\nhold, and grant us victory over the \ndisbelievers.\u201d \n\n148.  Consequently,  GOD  granted  them \nthe rewards of this world, and the \nbetter  rewards  of  the  Hereafter. \nGOD loves the good doers. \n\n149.  O you who believe, if you obey those \nwho disbelieve, they will turn you \nback on your heels, then you end up \nlosers. \n\n150.  GOD alone is your Lord and Mas- \nter, and He is the best supporter. \n\nGod Controls Your Enemies \n\n151.  We will throw terror into the hearts \nof those who disbelieved, since they \nset up besides GOD powerless idols. \nTheir destiny is Hell; what a miser-\nable abode for the transgressors! \n\nThe Battle of Uhud \n\n152.  GOD has fulfilled His promise to \nyou, and you defeated them by His \nleave. But then you wavered, dis- \nputed among yourselves, and dis- \nobeyed after He had shown you (the \nvictory) you had longed for. But \nthen,  some  of  you  became  dis- \ntracted by the spoils of this world, \nwhile others were rightly concerned \nwith  the  Hereafter.  He  then  di- \nverted you from them to test you. He \nhas pardoned  you.  GOD  showers \nthe believers with His grace. \n\n430 \n\n36808 \n\n \n\f"

Recall  that  you  rushed  (after  the \nspoils), paying no attention to any-\none, even when the messenger was \ncalling  from  behind  you.  Conse- \nquently, He substituted one  misery \nfor another, that you may not grieve \nover anything you had missed, or \nagonize over any hardship you had \nsuffered.  GOD  is  Cognizant  of \neverything you do. \n\nMoment of Death Predetermined \n\n154.  After  the  setback,  He  sent  down \nupon  you  peaceful  slumber  that \npacified some of you. Others among \nyou were selfishly concerned about \nthemselves.      They      harbored \nthoughts about GOD that were not \nright\u2014the  same  thoughts  they  had \nharbored  during  the  days  of  ig- \nnorance. Thus, they said, \u201cIs any-\nthing up to us?\u201d Say, \u201cEverything is \nup to GOD.\u201d They concealed inside \nthemselves what they did not reveal \nto you. They said, \u201cIf it was up to us, \nnone of us would have been killed in \nthis battle.\u201d Say, \u201cHad you stayed in \nyour homes, those destined  to be \nkilled would have crawled into their \ndeath beds.\u201d GOD thus puts you to \nthe test to bring out your true con- \nvictions, and to test what is in your \nhearts. GOD is fully aware of the \ninnermost thoughts. \n\n155.  Surely, those among you who turned \nback the day the two armies clashed \nhave been duped by the devil. This \nreflects some of the (evil) works they \nhad committed. GOD has pardoned \nthem. GOD is Forgiver, Clement. \n156.  O you who believe, do not be like \nthose who disbelieved and said of \n\ntheir kinsmen who traveled or mo-\nbilized  for  war,  \u201cHad  they  stayed \nwith us, they would not have died or \ngotten killed.\u201d GOD renders this a \nsource of grief in their hearts. GOD \ncontrols life and death. GOD is Seer \nof everything you do. \n\n157.  Whether you get killed or die in the \ncause of GOD, the forgiveness from \nGOD, and mercy are far better than \nanything they hoard. \n\n158.  Whether you die or get killed, you \nwill be summoned before GOD. \n\nThe Messenger\u2019s Kindness \n\n159.  It was mercy from GOD that you \nbecame  compassionate  towards \nthem.  Had  you  been  harsh  and \nmean-hearted, they would have a- \nbandoned you. Therefore, you shall \npardon them and ask forgiveness for \nthem, and consult them. Once you \nmake a decision, carry out your \nplan, and trust in GOD. GOD loves \nthose who trust in Him.* \n\n160.  If GOD supports you, none can de-\nfeat you. And if He abandons you, \nwho else can support you? In GOD \nthe believers shall trust. \n\nNo One Above the Law \n\n161.  Even the prophet cannot take more \nof the spoils of war than he is en-\ntitled to. Anyone who takes more \nthan his rightful share will have to \naccount for it on the Day of Resur- \nrection. That is when each soul is \npaid for whatever it earned, without \nthe least injustice. \n\n*3:159 The currency of the U.S.A. is the only currency that carries the phrase: \u201cIn God \nwe trust.\u201d It is a fact that the American dollar has been the strongest currency in the \nworld, and the standard by which all other currencies are measured. \n\n448 \n\n38060 \n\n\f"

They  certainly  occupy  different \nranks at GOD. GOD is Seer of ev- \nerything they do. \n\n164.  GOD  has  blessed  the  believers  by \nraising  in  their  midst  a  messenger \nfrom  among  them,  to  recite  for  them \nHis  revelations,  and  to  purify  them, \nand  to  teach  them  the  scripture  and \nwisdom.  Before  this,  they  had  gone \ntotally astray. \n\n165.

Do  not  think  that  those  who  are \nkilled  in  the  cause  of  GOD  are  dead; \nthey  are  alive  at  their  Lord,  enjoying \nHis provisions. \n\n170.  They  are  rejoicing  in  GOD\u2019s  grace, \nand  they  have  good  news  for  their \ncomrades  who  did  not  die  with \nthem,  that  they  have  nothing  to  fear, \nnor will they grieve. \n\n171.  They  have  good  news  of  GOD\u2019s \nblessings  and  grace,  and  that  GOD \nnever fails to reward the believers. \n172.  For  those  who  respond  to  GOD  and \nthe  messenger,  despite  the  persecu- \ntion  they  suffer,  and  maintain  their \ngood  works,  and  lead  a  righteous \nlife, a great reward. \n\n173.  When  the  people  say  to  them, \n\u201cPeople  have  mobilized  against  you; \nyou  should  fear  them,\u201d  this  only \nstrengthens  their  faith,  and  they  say, \n\u201cGOD  suffices  us;  He  is  the  best \nProtector.\u201d \n\n174.  They  have  deserved  GOD\u2019s  bless- \nings  and  grace.  No  harm  ever  touch- \nes  them,  for  they  have  attained \nGOD\u2019s  approval.

Do  not  fear  them \nand  fear  Me  instead,  if  you  are \nbelievers. \n\n176.  Do  not  be  saddened  by  those  who \nhasten  to  disbelieve.  They  never \nhurt  GOD  in  the  least.

During  distribution  of  the  inher- \nitances, if relatives, orphans, and \nneedy persons are present, you shall \ngive them therefrom, and treat them \nkindly. \n\n*4:1 This is the second longest sura, and the title indicates that it aims at defending the \nwomen\u2019s rights. Any interpretation must favor the women\u2019s rights, not the other way \naround. \n\n*4:3 See Appendix 30 for a detailed discussion of polygamy. \n497 \n\n42705 \n\n\f"

Those  who  are  concerned  about \ntheir  own  children,  in  case  they \nleave  them  behind,  shall  observe \nGOD and be equitable. \n\n10.  Those  who  consume  the  orphans\u2019 \nproperties  unjustly,  eat  fire  into \ntheir bellies, and will suffer in Hell. \n\nIf No Will    \nIs Left* \n\n11.  GOD  decrees  a  will  for  the  benefit \nof  your  children;  the  male  gets  twice \nthe  share  of  the  female.*  If  the  in-\nheritors  are  only  women,  more  than \ntwo,  they  get  two-thirds  of  what  is \nbequeathed.  If  only  one  daughter  is \nleft,  she  gets  one-half.  The  parents \nof  the  deceased  get  one-sixth  of  the \ninheritance  each,  if  the  deceased \nhas  left  any  children.  If  he  left  no \nchildren,  and  his  parents  are  the \nonly  inheritors,  the  mother  gets  one- \nthird.  If  he  has  siblings,  then  the \nmother  gets  one-sixth.  All  this,  after \nfulfilling  any  will*  the  deceased  has \nleft,  and  after  paying  off  all  debts. \nWhen  it  comes  to  your  parents  and \nyour  children,  you  do  not  know \nwhich  of  them  is  really  the  best  to \nyou  and  the  most  beneficial.  This  is \nGOD\u2019s  law.  GOD  is  Omniscient, \nMost Wise. \n\nInheritance \nFor the Spouses \n\n12.  You  get  half  of  what  your  wives \nleave behind, if they had no chil- \n\n47 \n\ndren.  If  they  had  children,  you  get \none-fourth  of  what  they  leave.  All \nthis,  after  fulfilling  any  will  they  had \nleft,  and  after  paying  off  all  debts. \nThey  get  one-fourth  of  what  you \nleave  behind,  if  you  had  no  children.   \nIf  you  had  children,  they  get  one-\neighth  of  what  you  bequeath.  All \nthis,  after  fulfilling  any  will  you  had \nleft,  and  after  paying  off  all  debts.  If \nthe  deceased  man  or  woman  was  a \nloner,  and  leaves  two  siblings,  male \nor  female,  each  of  them  gets  one-\nsixth  of  the  inheritance.  If  there  are \nmore  siblings,  then  they  equally \nshare  one-third  of  the  inheritance.  \nAll  this,  after  fulfilling  any  will,  and \nafter  paying  off  all  debts,  so  that  no \none is hurt. This is a will decreed by \nGOD.  GOD  is  Omniscient,  Cle-\nment. \n\nGod Communicates \nWith Us Through \nHis Messenger \n\n13.  These  are  GOD\u2019s  laws.  Those  who \nobey  GOD  and  His  messenger,  He \nwill  admit  them  into  gardens  with \nflowing  streams,  wherein  they  abide \nforever. This is the greatest triumph. \n14. As for  the one who disobeys GOD \nand  His  messenger,  and  transgres- \nses His laws, He will admit him into \nHell,  wherein  he  abides  forever.  He \nhas incurred a shameful retribution. \n\n*4:11 Generally, the son is responsible for a family, while the daughter is taken care of   \nby a husband. However, the Quran recommends in 2:180 that a will shall be left to \nconform with the specific circumstances of the deceased. For example, if the son is rich \nand the daughter is poor, one may leave a will giving the daughter everything, or twice  \nas much as the son. \n\n506 \n\n42764 \n\n \n\f"

Prohibited for you (in marriage) are \nyour  mothers,  your  daughters,  your \nsisters,  the  sisters  of  your  fathers, \nthe  sisters  of  your  mothers,  the \ndaughters  of  your  brother,  the \ndaughters  of  your  sister,  your  nurs- \ning  mothers,  the girls  who nursed \nfrom the same woman as you, the \nmothers of your wives, the daugh- \nters of your wives with whom you \nhave  consummated  the  marriage\u2014 \nif  the marriage  has  not been con-\nsummated,  you  may  marry  the \ndaughter.  Also  prohibited  for  you \nare the women who were married to \nyour genetic sons. Also, you shall \nnot be married to two sisters at the \nsame time\u2014but do not break up ex- \nisting marriages. GOD is Forgiver, \nMost Merciful. \n\n*4:15 A woman witnessed by four people in the act of committing adultery on four \ndifferent occasions, with four different partners, represents a danger to public health. \nSuch a woman is a depository of germs, and a health quarantine protects the society \nfrom  her.  A  good  example  of  an  exit  that  saves  a  quarantined  woman  is  marriage\u2014 \nsomeone may wish to marry her, and thus protect her and the society. \n*4:16 Public exposure of the sinners is a major deterrent, as we see in 5:38 and 24:2. \n513 \n\n42854 \n\n \n\f"

This  will  effectively  stop  you  from \nshopping  at  Market  X,  without  insulting  you.  Similarly,  God  provides  alternatives  to \nwife-beating;  reasoning  with  her  first,  then  employing  certain  negative  incentives. \nRemember that the theme of this sura is defending the women\u2019s rights and countering \nthe prevalent oppression of women.

You will find others who wish to \nmake peace with you, and also with \ntheir people. However, as soon as \nwar erupts, they fight against you. \nUnless these people leave you \nalone, offer you peace, and stop \nfighting you, you may fight them \nwhen you encounter them.

If one \nkills a believer by accident, he shall \natone by freeing a believing slave, \nand paying a compensation to the \nvictim\u2019s family, unless they forfeit \nsuch a compensation as a charity. If \nthe victim belonged to people who \nare at war with you, though he was a \nbeliever, you shall atone by freeing \na believing slave. If he belonged to \npeople with whom you have signed \na peace treaty, you shall pay the \ncompensation in addition to freeing \na believing slave. If you cannot find* \na slave to free, you shall atone by \nfasting two consecutive months, in \norder to be redeemed by GOD. \nGOD is Knower, Most Wise. \n\nAn Unforgivable Offense \n\n93.  Anyone who kills a believer on pur- \npose, his retribution is Hell, wherein \nhe abides forever, GOD is angry \nwith him, and condemns him, and \nhas prepared for him a terrible \nretribution. \n\n94.  O you who believe, if you strike in \nthe cause of GOD, you shall be ab- \nsolutely sure.

You  are \njust  humans  like  the  other  humans \nHe  created.\u201d  He  forgives  whomever \nHe  wills  and  punishes  whomever  He \nwills.

O  people  of  the  scripture,  our  mes- \nsenger  has  come  to  you,  to  explain \nthings  to  you,  after  a  period  of  time \nwithout  messengers,  lest  you  say, \n\u201cWe  did  not  receive  any  preacher  or \nwarner.\u201d  A  preacher  and  warner \nhas now come to you.

The name    \nof this messenger is mathematically coded into the Quran as \u201cRashad Khalifa.\u201d This   \nvery special verse warrants the presentation of specific evidence. By adding the gematrical \nvalue of \u201cRashad\u201d (505), plus the value of \u201cKhalifa\u201d (725), plus the sura number (5),    \nplus the verse number (19), we obtain a total of 505 + 725 + 5 + 19 = 1254, or 19x66. \nNineteen  is  the  Quran\u2019s  common  denominator,  which  was  revealed  through  Rashad \nKhalifa.

He \nsaid,  \u201cI  will  surely  kill  you.\u201d  He  said, \n\u201cGOD  accepts  only  from  the  right- \neous. \n\n28.  \u201cIf  you  extend  your  hand  to  kill  me, \nI  am  not  extending  my  hand  to  kill \nyou.  For  I  reverence  GOD,  Lord  of \nthe universe. \n\n  The Feast (Al-M\u00e3\u2019edah) 5:22-33 \n\n29.  \u201cI  want  you,  not  me,  to  bear  my  sin \nand  your  sin,  then  you  end  up  with \nthe  dwellers  of  Hell.  Such  is  the  re- \nquital for the transgressors.\u201d \n\n30.  His  ego  provoked  him  into  killing \nhis  brother.  He  killed  him,  and \nended up with the losers. \n\n31.  GOD  then  sent  a  raven  to  scratch \nthe soil, to teach him how to bury his \nbrother\u2019s  corpse.  He  said,  \u201cWoe  to \nme;  I  failed  to  be  as  intelligent  as \nthis  raven,  and  bury  my  brother\u2019s \ncorpse.\u201d  He  became  ridden  with \nremorse. \n\nGrossness of Murder \n\n32.  Because  of  this,  we  decreed  for  the \nChildren  of  Israel  that  anyone  who \nmurders  any  person  who  had  not \ncommitted  murder  or  horrendous \ncrimes,  it  shall  be  as  if  he  murdered \nall  the  people.  And  anyone  who \nspares  a  life,  it  shall  be  as  if  he \nspared  the  lives  of  all  the  people. \nOur  messengers  went  to  them  with \nclear  proofs  and  revelations,  but \nmost  of  them,  after  all  this,  are  still \ntransgressing. \n\nCapital Punishment: \nWhen is it Justified? \n\n33.  The  just  retribution  for  those  who \nfight  GOD  and  His  messenger,  and \ncommit  horrendous  crimes,  is  to  be \nkilled,  or  crucified,  or  to  have  their \nhands  and  feet  cut  off  on  alternate \nsides,  or  to  be  banished  from  the \nland.  This  is  to  humiliate  them  in \nthis  life,  then  they  suffer  a  far  worse \nretribution in the Hereafter. \n\n*5:27-31 The names of the two sons involved in this first murder are not relevant. But \nthey are given in the Bible as Abel and Cain (Genesis 4:2-9). \n\n765 \n\n55383 \n\n \n \n\f"

You \nshould  know  that  GOD  is  Forgiver, \nMost Merciful. \n\n35.  O  you  who  believe,  you  shall  rev- \nerence  GOD  and  seek  the  ways  and \nmeans  to  Him,  and  strive  in  His \ncause, that you may succeed. \n\nThe Cost of Disbelief \n\n36.  Certainly,  those  who  disbelieved,  if \nthey  possessed  everything  on  earth, \neven  twice  as  much,  and  offered  it  as \nransom  to  spare  them  the  retribu- \ntion  on  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  it \nwould  not  be  accepted  from  them; \nthey  have  incurred  a  painful  retribu- \ntion. \n\n37.  They  will  want  to  exit  Hell,  but  alas, \nthey  can  never  exit  therefrom;  their \nretribution is eternal. \n\nMathematical Proof \nSupports Quranic Justice \n38.  The  thief,  male  or  female,  you  shall \nmark  their  hands*  as  a  punishment \nfor  their  crime,  and  to  serve  as  an \nexample  from  GOD.  GOD  is  Al-\nmighty, Most Wise. \n\n39.  If  one  repents  after  committing  this \ncrime,  and  reforms,  GOD  redeems \nhim.  GOD  is  Forgiver,  Most  Merci- \nful. \n\n40.  Do  you  not  know  that  GOD  posses- \nses  the  sovereignty  of  the  heavens \nand  the  earth?  He  punishes  whom-\never  He  wills,  and  forgives  whom-\never He wills. GOD is Omnipotent. \n41.

Among \nthe  Jews,  some  listened  to  lies.  They \nlistened  to  people  who  never  met \nyou,  and  who  distorted  the  words \nout  of  context,  then  said,  \u201cIf  you  are \ngiven  this,  accept  it,  but  if  you  are \ngiven  anything  different,  beware.\u201d \nWhomever  GOD  wills  to  divert,  you \ncan  do  nothing  to  help  him  against \nGOD. GOD does not wish to cleanse \ntheir  hearts.  They  have  incurred \nhumiliation  in  this  world,  and  in  the \nHereafter,  they  will  suffer  a  terrible \nretribution. \n\n42.  They  are  upholders  of  lies,  and \neaters  of  illicit  earnings.  If  they \ncome  to  you  to  judge  among  them, \nyou  may  judge  among  them,  or  you \nmay  disregard  them.  If  you  choose \nto  disregard  them,  they  cannot  harm \nyou  in  the  least.  But  if  you  judge \namong  them,  you  shall  judge  equi- \ntably.  GOD  loves  those  who  are \nequitable. \n\n*5:38 The practice of cutting off the thief\u2019s hand, as decreed by the false Muslims, is a \nsatanic practice without Quranic basis. Due to the special importance of this example, \nGod has provided mathematical proof in support of marking the hand of the thief, rather \nthan severing it. Verse 12:31 refers to the women who so admired Joseph that they \u201ccut\u201d \ntheir hands. Obviously, they did not \u201ccut off\u201d their hands; nobody can. The sum of sura \nand verse numbers are the same for 5:38 and 12:31, i.e., 43. It is also the will and mercy \nof  God  that  this  mathematical  relationship  conforms  with  the  Quran\u2019s  19-based  code. \nNineteen verses after 12:31, we see the same word (12:50). \n\n777 \n\n55652 \n\n \n \n\f"

Anyone \nwho  kills  any  game  on  purpose,  his \nfine  shall  be  a  number  of  livestock \nanimals  that  is  equivalent  to  the \ngame  animals  he  killed.  The  judg- \nment  shall  be  set  by  two  equitable \npeople  among  you.  They  shall  make \nsure  that  the  offerings  reach  the \nKa\u2018bah.  Otherwise,  he  may  expiate \nby  feeding  poor  people,  or  by  an \nequivalent  fast  to  atone  for  his  of- \nfense.  GOD  has  pardoned  past  of- \nfenses.

O  you  who  believe,  do  not  ask  about \nmatters  which,  if  revealed  to  you \nprematurely,  would  hurt  you.  If  you \nask  about  them  in  light  of  the  Quran, \nthey  will  become  obvious  to  you. \nGOD  has  deliberately  overlooked \nthem. GOD is Forgiver, Clement. \n102.

When  he  saw  the  sun  rising,  he  said, \n\u201cThis  must  be  my  Lord.  This  is  the \nbiggest.\u201d  But  when  it  set,  he  said,  \u201cO \nmy  people,  I  denounce  your  idol- \natry. \n\n79.  \u201cI  have  devoted  myself  absolutely  to \nthe  One  who  initiated  the  heavens \nand  the  earth;  I  will  never  be  an  idol \nworshiper.\u201d \n\n80.  His  people  argued  with  him.  He \nsaid,  \u201cDo  you  argue  with  me  about \nGOD,  after  He  has  guided  me?  I \nhave  no  fear  of  the  idols you  set up. \nNothing  can  happen  to  me,  unless \nmy  Lord  wills  it.  My  Lord\u2019s  knowl- \nedge  encompasses  all  things.

They  will  say, \n\u201cWe  bear  witness  against  oursel- \nves.\u201d  They  were  totally  preoccupied \nwith  the  worldly  life,  and  they  will \nbear  witness  against  themselves  that \nthey were disbelievers. \n\n131.

Your \nLord  is  never  unaware  of  anything \nthey do. \n\n133.  Your  Lord  is  the  Rich  One;  posses- \nsor of all mercy.

Thus  were  the  idol  worshipers \nduped  by  their  idols,  to  the  extent  of \nkilling  their  own  children.*  In  fact, \ntheir  idols  inflict  great  pain  upon \nthem,  and  confuse  their  religion  for \nthem.  Had  GOD  willed,  they  would \nnot  have  done  it.  You  shall  dis- \nregard them and their fabrications. \n\nReligious Innovations \nCondemned \n\n138.  They  said,  \u201cThese  are  livestock  and \ncrops  that  are  prohibited;  no  one \nshall  eat  them  except  whomever  we \npermit,\u201d  so  they  claimed.  They  also \nprohibited  the  riding  of  certain  live- \nstock.  Even  the  livestock  they \nate,  they  never  pronounced  GOD\u2019s \nname  as  they  sacrificed  them.  Such \nare innovations attributed to Him. \n\nLivestock (Al-An\u2018\u00e3m) 6:135-142 \n\nHe  will  surely  requite  them  for  their \ninnovations. \n\n139.  They  also  said,  \u201cWhat  is  in  the  bel- \nlies  of  these  livestock  is  reserved \nexclusively  for  the  males  among  us, \nand  prohibited  for  our  wives.\u201d  But  if \nit  was  a  stillbirth,  they  permitted \ntheir  wives  to  share  therein.  He  will \ncertainly  requite  them  for  their  in- \nnovations.  He  is  Most  Wise,  Omnis- \ncient. \n\n140.  Losers  indeed  are  those  who  killed \ntheir  children  foolishly,  due  to  their \nlack  of  knowledge,  and  prohibited \nwhat  GOD  has  provided  for  them, \nand  followed  innovations  attributed \nto  GOD.  They  have  gone  astray; \nthey are not guided. \n\nZakat Must Be Given         \n\n\u201cOn The Day Of Harvest\u201d* \n\n141.  He  is  the  One  who  established  gar-\ndens,  trellised  and  untrellised,  and \npalm  trees,  and  crops  with  different \ntastes,  and  olives,  and  pomegran- \nate\u2014fruits  that  are  similar,  yet  dis-\nsimilar.  Eat  from  their  fruits,  and \ngive  the  due alms  on the  day  of har- \nvest,*  and  do  not  waste  anything.  He \ndoes not love the wasters. \n\n142.  Some  livestock  supply  you  with \ntransportation,  as  well  as  bedding \nmaterials.  Eat  from  GOD\u2019s  provi- \nsions  to  you,  and  do  not  follow  the \nsteps  of  Satan;  he  is  your  most  ar- \ndent enemy. \n\n*6:137  A  perfect  example  is  the  internationally  infamous  incident  of  the  execution  of  a \nSaudi Arabian princess in 1978 for alleged adultery. God\u2019s law institutes whipping, not \nexecution,  as  a  punishment  for  adultery  (24:1-2),  while  the  idolatrous  laws  stipulate \nexecution.  As  pointed  out  in  42:21,  the  traditionalists  follow  a  religion  that  is  not \nauthorized by God. \n*6:141 Zakat charity is so important, the Most Merciful has restricted His mercy to those \nwho give it (7:156). Yet, the corrupted Muslims have lost this most important command-\nment; they give Zakat only once a year. We see here that Zakat must be given away \u201con  \nthe day we receive income.\u201d The proportion that came to us through Abraham is 2.5% \nof our net income. \n943 \n\n64290 \n\n\f"

Tell me \nwhat you know, if you are truthful.\u201d \n144.  Regarding the two kinds of camels, \nand the two kinds of cattle, say, \u201cIs \nit the two males that He prohibited, \nor the two females, or the contents \nof the wombs of the two females? \nWere  you witnesses  when  GOD \ndecreed such prohibitions for you? \nWho is more evil than those who \ninvent such lies and attribute them \nto GOD? They thus mislead the \npeople  without  knowledge.  GOD \ndoes not guide such evil people.\u201d \n\nThe Only Dietary Prohibitions* \n\n145.  Say, \u201cI do not find in the revelations \ngiven to me any food that is pro-\nhibited for any eater except: (1) car- \nrion,  (2)  running  blood,  (3)  the \nmeat* of pigs, for it is contaminated, \nand (4) the meat of animals blas-\nphemously dedicated to other than \nGOD.\u201d If one is forced (to eat these), \nwithout being deliberate or mali- \ncious, then your Lord is Forgiver, \nMost Merciful. \n\n146.  For those who are Jewish we pro-\nhibited animals with undivided \n\n87 \n\nhoofs; and of the cattle and sheep \nwe  prohibited  the  fat,  except  that \nwhich is carried on their backs, or in \nthe  viscera,  or  mixed  with  bones. \nThat  was  a  retribution  for  their \ntransgressions, and we are truthful. \n\n147.  If  they  disbelieve  you,  then  say, \n\u201cYour Lord possesses infinite mer- \ncy, but His retribution is unavoid- \nable for the guilty people.\u201d \n\n148.  The idol worshipers say, \u201cHad GOD \nwilled, we would not practice idol- \natry, nor would our parents, nor \nwould we prohibit anything.\u201d Thus \ndid those before them disbelieve, \nuntil they incurred our retribution. \nSay,  \u201cDo  you  have  any  proven \nknowledge that you can show us? \nYou follow nothing but conjecture; \nyou only guess.\u201d \n\nThe Most Powerful \nArgument* \n\n149.  Say,  \u201cGOD  possesses  the  most \npowerful argument; if He wills He \ncan guide all of you.\u201d \n\n150.  Say,  \u201cBring  your  witnesses  who \nwould testify that GOD has pro-\nhibited this or that.\u201d If they testify, \ndo not testify with them. Nor shall \nyou follow the opinions of those who \nreject  our  revelations,  and  those \nwho disbelieve in the Hereafter, and \nthose who stray away from their \nLord. \n\n*6:145-146  Only  four  kinds  of  animal  products  are  prohibited:  animals  that  die  of \nthemselves, running blood (not trapped within the meat), the meat of pigs, and animals \ndedicated to other than their Creator. Verse 146 informs us that such prohibitions are \nvery specific; God prohibits either \u201cthe meat\u201d or \u201cthe fat,\u201d or both, if He so wills. \n\n*6:149 The Quran\u2019s mathematical code is a tangible and utterly incontrovertible proof \nthat this is God\u2019s message to the world.

Do not corrupt the earth after it has \nbeen set straight, and worship Him \nout of reverence, and out of hope. \nSurely, GOD\u2019s mercy is attainable \nby the righteous. \n\n57.

When  they  passed  by \npeople  who  were  worshiping  stat-\nues,  they  said,  \u201cO  Moses,  make  a \ngod  for  us,  like  the  gods  they  have.\u201d \nHe  said,  \u201cIndeed,  you  are  ignorant \npeople. \n\n139.  \u201cThese  people  are  committing  a \nblasphemy,  for  what  they  are  doing \nis disastrous for them. \n\n140.  \u201cShall  I  seek  for  you  other  than \nGOD  to  be  your  god,  when  He  has \nblessed  you  more  than  anyone  else \nin the world?\u201d \n\n The Purgatory (Al-A\u2018ar\u00e3f) 7:134-145 \n\nReminder to the Children of Israel \n\n141.  Recall  that  we  delivered  you  from \nPharaoh\u2019s  people,  who  inflicted  the \nworst  persecution  upon  you,  killing \nyour  sons  and  sparing  your  daugh-\nters.  That  was  an  exacting  trial  for \nyou from your Lord. \n\nOur World Cannot Stand       \n\nthe Physical Presence of God \n\n142.  We  summoned  Moses  for  thirty* \nnights,  and  completed  them  by  ad-\nding  ten.*  Thus,  the  audience  with \nhis  Lord  lasted  forty*  nights.  Moses \nsaid  to  his  brother  Aaron,  \u201cStay \nhere  with  my  people,  maintain  right-\neousness,  and  do  not  follow  the  ways \nof the corruptors.\u201d \n\n143.  When  Moses  came  at  our  appointed \ntime,  and  his  Lord  spoke  with  him, \nhe  said,  \u201cMy  Lord,  let  me  look  and \nsee  You.\u201d  He  said,  \u201cYou  cannot  see \nMe.  Look  at  that  mountain;  if  it  stays \nin  its  place,  then  you  can  see  Me.\u201d \nThen,  his  Lord  manifested  Himself \nto  the  mountain,  and  this  caused  it \nto  crumble.  Moses  fell  unconscious. \nWhen  he  came  to,  he  said,  \u201cBe  You \nglorified.  I  repent  to  You,  and  I  am \nthe most convinced believer.\u201d \n\n144.  He  said,  \u201cO  Moses,  I  have  chosen \nyou,  out  of  all  the  people,  with  My \nmessages  and  by  speaking  to  you. \nTherefore,  take  what  I  have  given \nyou and be appreciative.\u201d \n\n145.  We  wrote  for  him  on  the  tablets  all \nkinds  of  enlightenments  and  details  \nof  everything:  \u201cYou  shall  uphold \nthese  teachings  strongly,  and  exhort \nyour  people  to  uphold  them\u2014these \nare  the  best  teachings.  I  will  point \nout for you the fate of the wicked.\u201d \n\n*7:142 The manner in which these numbers are mentioned is significant As detailed in \nAppendix 1, all the numbers mentioned in the Quran add up to 162146, 19x8534. \n\n1001 \n\n   68092 \n\n \n\f"

I  will  divert  from  My  revelations \nthose  who  are  arrogant  on  earth, \nwithout \njustification.  Consequently, \nwhen  they  see  every  kind  of  proof \nthey  will  not  believe.  And  when  they \nsee  the  path  of  guidance  they  will \nnot  adopt  it  as  their  path,  but  when \nthey  see  the  path  of  straying  they  will \nadopt  it  as  their  path.  This  is  the \nconsequence  of  their  rejecting  our \nproofs,  and  being  totally  heedless \nthereof. \n\n147.  Those  who  reject  our  revelations \nand  the  meeting  of  the  Hereafter, \ntheir  works  are  nullified.  Are  they \nrequited  only  for  what  they  com-\nmitted? \n\nThe Golden Calf \n\n148.  During  his  absence,  Moses\u2019  people \nmade  from  their  jewelry  the  statue \nof a calf, complete with the sound of \na calf.* Did they not see that it could \nnot  speak  to  them,  or  guide  them  in \nany  path?  They  worshiped  it,  and \nthus turned wicked. \n\n149.  Finally,  when  they  regretted  their \naction,  and  realized  that  they  had \ngone  astray,  they  said,  \u201cUnless  our \nLord  redeems  us  with  His  mercy, \nand forgives us, we will be losers.\u201d \n150.  When  Moses  returned  to  his  peo-\nple,  angry  and  disappointed,  he \nsaid,  \u201cWhat  a  terrible  thing  you  have \ndone  in  my  absence!  Could  you  not \nwait  for  the  commandments  of  your \nLord?\u201d  He  threw  down  the  tablets, \nand took hold of his brother\u2019s head, \n\npulling  him  towards  himself.  (Aar-\non)  said,  \u201cSon  of  my  mother,  the \npeople  took  advantage  of  my  weak-\nness,  and  almost  killed  me.  Let  not \nmy  enemies  rejoice,  and  do  not \ncount  me  with  the  transgressing \npeople.\u201d \n\n151.  (Moses)  said,  \u201cMy  Lord,  forgive  me \nand  my  brother,  and  admit  us  into \nYour  mercy.  Of  all  the  merciful \nones, You are the Most Merciful.\u201d \n152.  Surely,  those  who  idolized  the  calf \nhave  incurred  wrath  from  their \nLord,  and  humiliation  in  this  life. \nWe thus requite the innovators. \n153.  As  for  those  who  committed  sins, \nthen  repented  thereafter  and  be-\nlieved,  your  Lord\u2014after  this\u2014is \nForgiver, Most Merciful. \n\n154.  When  Moses\u2019  anger  subsided,  he \npicked  up  the  tablets,  containing \nguidance  and  mercy  for  those  who \nreverence their Lord. \n\n155.  Moses  then  selected  seventy  men \nfrom  among  his  people,  to  come  to \nour  appointed  audience.  When  the \nquake  shook  them,  he  said,  \u201cMy \nLord,  You  could  have  annihilated \nthem  in  the  past,  together  with  me, \nif  You  so  willed.  Would  You  annihi-\nlate  us  for  the  deeds  of  those  among \nus  who  are  foolish?  This  must  be  the \ntest  that  You  have  instituted  for  us. \nWith  it,  You  condemn  whomever \nYou  will,  and  guide  whomever  You \nwill.  You  are  our  Lord  and  Master, \nso  forgive  us,  shower  us  with  Your \nmercy; You are the best Forgiver. \n\n*7:148 How the golden calf acquired the sound of a calf is explained in Footnote 20:96. \n\n1001 \n\n68092 \n\n\f"

We \nhave  repented  to  You.\u201d  He  said, \n\u201cMy  retribution  befalls  whomever  I \nwill.  But  My  mercy  encompasses  all \nthings.  However,  I  will  specify  it  for \nthose  who  (1)  lead  a  righteous  life, \n(2)  give  the  obligatory  charity  (Za-\nkat),*  (3)  believe  in  our  revelations, \nand \n\n157.  \u201c(4)  follow  the  messenger,  the  gen-\ntile  prophet  (Muhammad),  whom \nthey  find  written  in  their  Torah  and \nGospel.*  He  exhorts  them  to  be \nrighteous,  enjoins  them  from  evil, \nallows  for  them  all  good  food,  and \nprohibits  that  which  is  bad,  and  un-\nloads  the  burdens  and  the  shackles \nimposed  upon  them.  Those  who \nbelieve  in  him,  respect  him,  support \nhim,  and  follow  the  light  that  came \nwith him are the successful ones.\u201d \n158.  Say,  \u201cO  people,  I  am  GOD\u2019s  mes-\nsenger to all of you. To Him belongs \nthe  sovereignty  of  the  heavens  and \nthe  earth.  There  is  no  god  except \nHe.  He  controls  life  and  death.\u201d \nTherefore,  you  shall  believe  in  GOD \nand  His  messenger,  the  gentile \nprophet,  who  believes  in  GOD  and \nHis  words.  Follow  him,  that  you  may \nbe guided. \n\nThe Guided Jews \n\n159.  Among  the  followers  of  Moses \nthere  are  those  who  guide  in  accord-\nance  with  the  truth,  and  the  truth \nrenders them righteous. \n\nMiracles in Sinai \n\n160.  We  divided  them  into  twelve  tribal \ncommunities,  and  we  inspired  Mo-\nses  when  his  people  asked  him  for \nwater:  \u201cStrike  the  rock  with  your \nstaff,\u201d  whereupon  twelve  springs \ngushed  out  therefrom.  Thus,  each \ncommunity  knew  its  water.  And  we \nshaded  them  with  clouds,  and  sent \ndown  to  them  manna  and  quails: \n\u201cEat  from  the  good  things  we  pro-\nvided  for  you.\u201d  It  is  not  us  that  they \nwronged;  it  is  they  who  wronged \ntheir own souls. \n\nRebellion Despite the Miracles \n\n161.  Recall  that  they  were  told,  \u201cGo  into \nthis  town  to  live,  and  eat  therefrom \nas  you  please,  treat  the  people  ami-\ncably,  and  enter  the  gate  humbly. \nWe  will  then  forgive  your  transgres-\nsions.  We  will  multiply  the  reward \nfor the righteous.\u201d \n\n162.  But  the  evil  ones  among  them  sub-\nstituted  other  commands  for  the \ncommands  given  to  them.  Conse-\nquently,  we  sent  upon  them  con-\ndemnation  from  the  sky,  because  of \ntheir wickedness. \n\nObserving the Commandments \nBrings Prosperity \n\n163.  Remind  them  of  the  community  by \nthe  sea,  who  desecrated  the  Sab-\nbath.  When  they  observed  the  Sab-\nbath,  the  fish  came  to  them  abun-\ndantly.  And  when  they  violated  the \nSabbath,  the  fish  did  not  come.  We \nthus  afflicted  them,  as  a  conse-\nquence of their transgression. \n\n*7:156 The importance of the obligatory charity (Zakat) cannot be over emphasized.  \nAs instituted in 6:141, Zakat must be given away upon receiving any income\u20142.5% of \none\u2019s net income must be given to the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and   \nthe traveling alien, in this order (see 2:215). \n*7:157 Muhammad is prophesied in Deuteronomy 18:15-19 and John 14:16-17 & 16:13. \n 1004 \n 68250 \n\n \n\f"

Recall that a group of them said, \n\u201cWhy should you preach to people \nwhom GOD will surely annihilate or \npunish severely?\u201d They answered, \n\u201cApologize to your Lord,\u201d that they \nmight be saved. \n\n165.  When they disregarded what they \nwere reminded of, we saved those \nwho prohibited evil, and afflicted \nthe wrongdoers with a terrible retri-\nbution for their wickedness. \n166.  When they continued to defy the \ncommandments, we said to them, \n\u201cBe you despicable apes.\u201d \n\n167.  Additionally,  your  Lord  has  de-\ncreed that He will raise up against \nthem people who will inflict severe \npersecution upon them, until the \nDay of Resurrection. Your Lord is \nmost efficient in enforcing retribu-\ntion, and He is certainly the For- \ngiver, Most Merciful. \n\n168.  We  scattered  them  among  many \ncommunities  throughout  the  land. \nSome of them were righteous, and \nsome were less than righteous. We \ntested  them  with  prosperity  and \nhardship, that they may return. \n169.  Subsequent to them, He substituted \nnew generations who inherited the \nscripture. But they opted for the \nworldly life instead, saying, \u201cWe will \nbe forgiven.\u201d But then they con-\ntinued to opt for the materials of this \nworld. Did they not make a cove-\nnant to uphold the scripture, and \nnot to say about GOD except the \ntruth? Did they not study the scrip- \n\nture?  Certainly,  the  abode  of  the \nHereafter is far better for those who \nmaintain righteousness. Do you not \nunderstand? \n\n170.  Those  who  uphold  the  scripture, \nand  observe  the  Contact  Prayers \n(Salat), we never fail to recompense \nthe pious. \n\n171.  We raised the mountain above them \nlike an umbrella, and they thought it \nwas going to fall on them: \u201cYou shall \nuphold what we have given you, \nstrongly,  and  remember  the  con-\ntents thereof, that you may be sav-\ned.\u201d \n\nWe Are Born With Instinctive \nKnowledge About God* \n\n172.  Recall that your Lord summoned all \nthe descendants of Adam, and had \nthem bear witness for themselves: \n\u201cAm I not your Lord?\u201d They all \nsaid, \u201cYes. We bear witness.\u201d Thus, \nyou cannot say on the Day of Resur-\nrection, \u201cWe were not aware of \nthis.\u201d \n\n173.  Nor can you say, \u201cIt was our parents \nwho  practiced  idolatry,  and  we \nsimply followed in their footsteps. \nWill You punish us because of what \nothers have innovated?\u201d \n\n174.  We thus explain the revelations, to \nenable the people to redeem them-\nselves.* \n\n175.  Recite for them the news of one who \nwas given our proofs, but chose to \ndisregard  them.  Consequently,  the \ndevil pursued him, until he became \na strayer. \n\n*7:172 Thus, every human being is born with an instinctive knowledge about God. \n*7:174 This life is our last chance to return to God\u2019s Kingdom (See INTRODUC-\nTION). \n\n1006 \n\n68583 \n\n\f"

GOD gave you this good news to \nstrengthen  your  hearts.  Victory \ncomes only from GOD. GOD is Al-\nmighty, Most Wise. \n\n11.  He  caused  peaceful  slumber  to \novertake you and pacify you, and He \nsent down water from the sky to \nclean you therewith.

You  may  strike  them \nabove the necks, and you may strike \neven every finger.\u201d \n\n13.  This is what they have justly in-\ncurred by fighting GOD and His \nmessenger.

O you who believe, if you encounter \nthe disbelievers who have mobilized \nagainst you, do not turn back and \nflee. \n\n16.  Anyone who turns back on that day, \nexcept to carry out a battle plan, or \nto join his group, has incurred wrath \nfrom GOD, and his abode is Hell; \nwhat a miserable destiny! \n\nGod Is Doing \nEverything* \n\n17.  It  was  not  you  who  killed  them; \nGOD is the One who killed them. It \nwas not you who threw when you \nthrew; GOD is the One who threw. \nBut He thus gives the believers a \nchance to earn a lot of credit. GOD \nis Hearer, Omniscient. \n\n18.  Additionally,  GOD  thus  nullifies \nthe schemes of the disbelievers. \n19.  You sought victory (O disbelievers), \nand victory did come; it belonged to \nthe believers. If you refrain (from \naggression) it would be better for \nyou, but if you return, so will we. \nYour armies will never help you, no \nmatter how great. For GOD is on the \nside of the believers. \n\n20.  O you who believe, obey GOD and \nHis  messenger,  and  do  not  dis-\nregard him while you hear. \n\nThe Disbelievers Blocked Out \n\n21.  Do not be like those who say, \u201cWe \nhear,\u201d when they do not hear. \n22.  The worst creatures in the sight of \nGOD are the deaf and dumb, who \ndo not understand. \n\n23.  Had GOD known of any good in \nthem, He would have made them \nhearers.  Even  if  He  made  them \nhearers, they still would turn away in \naversion. \n\nThe Righteous Do Not Really Die* \n24.  O you who believe, you shall re-\nspond to GOD and to the messenger \nwhen he invites you to what gives \nyou life.* You should know that \nGOD is closer to you than your \nheart, and that before Him you will \nbe summoned. \n\n25.  Beware of a retribution that may not \nbe limited to the evildoers among \nyou.* You should know that GOD\u2019s \nretribution is severe. \n\nGod Supports the Believers \n\n26.  Remember that you used to be few \nand  oppressed,  fearing  that  the \npeople  may  snatch  you,  and  He \ngranted you a secure sanctuary, sup-\nported you with His victory, and \nprovided you with good provisions, \nthat you may be appreciative. \n27.  O you who believe, do not betray \nGOD and the messenger, and do not \nbetray those who trust you, now that \nyou know. \n\n*8:17 Believing in God necessitates believing in His qualities, one of which is that He is \ndoing  everything  Without  knowing  God,  there  is  no  belief  (23:84-90).  Bad  things  are \nincurred by us, and executed by Satan, in accordance with God\u2019s laws (4:78-79, 42:30). \n\n*8:24 See Appendix 17.

You should know that your money \nand your children are a test, and \nthat GOD possesses a great recom-\npense. \n\n29.  O you who believe, if you reverence \nGOD, He will enlighten you, remit \nyour sins, and forgive you. GOD \npossesses infinite grace. \n\nGod Protects His Messenger* \n\n30.  The disbelievers plot and scheme to \nneutralize you, or kill you, or ban-\nish you. However, they plot and \nscheme, but so does GOD. GOD is \nthe best schemer. \n\n31.  When our revelations are recited to \nthem, they say, \u201cWe have heard. If \nwe wanted to, we could have said the \nsame things. These are no more \nthan tales from the past!\u201d \n\n32.  They also said, \u201cOur god, if this is \nreally the truth  from You, then \nshower us with rocks from the sky, \nor pour upon us a painful punish-\nment.\u201d \n\n33.  However, GOD is not  to punish \nthem while you are in their midst; \nGOD is not to punish them while \nthey are seeking forgiveness. \n\n34. Have  they  not  deserved  GOD\u2019s \nretribution, by repelling others from \nthe Sacred Masjid, even though they \nare  not  the  custodians  thereof? \nThe true custodians thereof are the \nrighteous, but most of them do not \nknow. \n\nThe Contact Prayers (Salat) \nExisted Before the Quran* \n35.  Their  Contact  Prayers  (Salat)  at  the \nshrine  (Ka\u2018bah)  were  no  more  than   \na  mockery  and  a  means of  repelling \nthe  people  (by  crowding  them  out). \nTherefore,  suffer  the  retribution  for \nyour disbelief. \n\n  Spending Their Money     \n\nto Fight God* \n\n36.  Those  who  disbelieve  spend  their \nmoney to repel others from the way \nof GOD. They will spend it, then it \nwill turn into sorrow and remorse \nfor them. Ultimately, they will be \ndefeated, and all disbelievers will be \nsummoned to Hell. \n\n37.  GOD will sift away the bad from the \ngood, then pile the bad on top of \neach other, all in one pile, then \nthrow it in Hell. Such are the losers. \n\n*8:30 God chose His final prophet, Muhammad, from the strongest tribe of Arabia. It  \nwas  tribal  law  and  traditions  that  prevented  the  disbelievers\u2014by  God\u2019s  leave\u2014from \nkilling Muhammad. Similarly, it was God\u2019s will to move His Messenger of the Covenant \nfrom  the  Middle  East,  where  he  would  have  been  killed,  to  the  U.S.A.  where  God\u2019s \nmessage  can  flourish  and  reach  every  corner  of  the  globe.  This  is  mathematically \nconfirmed: the sura & verse numbers = 8 + 30 = 38 = 19x2. \n\n*8:35  All  religious  practices  in  Islam  came  to  us  through  Abraham;  when  the  Quran   \nwas revealed, all rites in \u201cSubmission\u201d were already in existence (21:73, 22:78). \n\n*8:36  The  idol  worshiping  leaders  of  corrupted  Islam,  Saudi  Arabia,  have  allocated \nhuge  sums of  money  annually to  fight God  and His  miracle. For  example,  the  famous \nLebanese  publisher  D\u00e3r  Al-\u2018Ilm  Lil-Mal\u00e3y\u00een  (Knowledge  for  the  Millions)  published \nthe Arabic version of \u201cThe Miracle of the Quran\u201d in March, 1983.

Had  He  made  them  ap-\npear more numerous, you would \n\nhave failed, and you would have dis-\nputed among yourselves. But GOD \nsaved the situation. He is Knower of \nthe innermost thoughts. \n\n44.

You shall obey GOD and His mes-\nsenger, and do not dispute among \nyourselves, lest you fail and scatter \nyour strength. You shall steadfastly \npersevere. GOD is with those who \nsteadfastly persevere. \n\n47.  Do not be like those who left their \nhomes grudgingly, only to show off, \nand in fact discouraged others from \nfollowing the path of GOD. GOD is \nfully aware of everything they do. \n\nThe Devil Sees God\u2019s \nInvisible Soldiers \n\n48.  The devil had adorned their works \nin their eyes, and said, \u201cYou cannot \nbe defeated by any people today,\u201d \nand \u201cI will be fighting along with \nyou.\u201d But as soon as the two armies \nfaced each other, he turned back on \nhis heels and fled, saying, \u201cI disown \nyou.

Whatever  you \nspend in the cause of GOD will be \nrepaid  to  you  generously,  without \nthe least injustice. \n\n61.  If they resort to peace, so shall you, \nand put your trust in GOD. He is the \nHearer, the Omniscient. \n\nGod Suffices the Believers \n\n62.  If they want to deceive you, then \nGOD will suffice you. He will help \nyou with His support, and with the \nbelievers. \n\n63.  He has reconciled the hearts (of the \nbelievers).

Those who  believe, and emigrate, \nand strive in the cause of GOD with \ntheir money and their lives, are far \ngreater in rank in the sight of GOD. \nThese are the winners. \n\n21.  Their Lord gives them good news: \nmercy and approval from Him, and \ngardens where they rejoice in ever-\nlasting bliss. \n\n22.  Eternally they abide therein. GOD \npossesses a great recompense. \n\nIf You Have to Make a Choice \n\n23.  O you who believe, do not ally your-\nselves even with your parents and \nyour siblings, if they prefer dis-\nbelieving over believing. Those a-\nmong you who ally themselves with \nthem are transgressing. \n\nImportant Criterion* \n\n24.  Proclaim:  \u201cIf  your  parents,  your \nchildren, your siblings, your spous-\nes, your family, the money you have \nearned, a business you worry about, \nand the homes you cherish are more \nbeloved to you than GOD and His \nmessenger,** and the striving in His \ncause, then just wait until GOD \nbrings His judgment.\u201d GOD does \nnot guide the wicked people. \n\n*9:24 Since the odds are overwhelming against any human being to actually believe and \ndevote  the  worship  to  God  alone  (12:103,  106),  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  see  a  whole   \nfamily believe. Thus, most believers have been faced with the choice: \u201cEither me or God    \nand  His  messenger.\u201d  This  choice  is  consistently  stated  by  spouses  of  the  believers,  or         \ntheir  parents,  their  children,  etc.  Consistently,  the  believers  made  the  right  choice.  This           \nis a mandatory test for all believers (29:2). \n\n**9:24 The Quranic, mathematical evidence points specifically at God\u2019s Messenger of \nthe  Covenant.  By  adding  the gematrical  value of  \u201cRashad\u201d  (505),  plus  the  value  of \n\u201cKhalifa\u201d (725), plus the verse number (24), we get 505 + 725 + 24 = 1254 = 19x66. \n\n1138 \n\n73037 \n\n \n\f"

There is no god except He. Be \nHe glorified, high above having any \npartners. \n\n32.

The  count  of  months,  as  far  as  GOD \nis  concerned,  is  twelve.*  This  has \nbeen GOD\u2019s law, since the day He \ncreated  the  heavens  and  the  earth. \nFour of them are sacred. This is the \n\nperfect  religion;  you  shall  not  wrong \nyour  souls  (by  fighting)  during  the \nSacred  Months.  However,  you  may \ndeclare  all-out  war  against  the  idol \nworshipers  (even  during  the  Sacred \nMonths),  when  they  declare  all-out \nwar  against  you,  and  know  that \nGOD is on the side of the righteous. \n\nAltering the Sacred Months * \n37.  Altering  the  Sacred  Months  is  a  sign \nof  excessive  disbelief;  it  augments \nthe  straying  of  those  who  have  dis-\nbelieved.  They  alternate  the  Sacred \nMonths  and  the  regular  months, \nwhile  preserving  the  number  of \nmonths  consecrated  by  GOD.  They \nthus  violate  what  GOD  has  con-\nsecrated.  Their  evil  works  are  a-\ndorned  in  their  eyes.  GOD  does  not \nguide the disbelieving people. \n\n38.

The  materials  of  this \nworld,  compared  to  the  Hereafter, \nare nil. \n\n*9:33 This statement, letter for letter, occurs here and in 61:9.

This confirms that the messenger here is Rashad Khalifa. \nAdditionally, the number of verses from 9:33 to 61:9 (3902) + 9 + 33 + 61 + 9 + the value \nof \u201cRashad Khalifa\u201d (1230) gives 5244, also a multiple of 19. The gematrical value of \n9:33 & 61:9, calculated by adding the values of every letter, is 7858. By adding this \nnumber, plus the number of letters in the two verses (120), plus the number of verses \nfrom 9:33 to 61:9 (3902), plus the value of \u201cRashad Khalifa\u201d (1230), we get \n7858 + 120 + 3902 + 1230 = 13110 = 19x690.

The  only  reason  Abraham  asked \nforgiveness  for  his  father  was  that  he \nhad  promised  him  to  do  so.  But  as \nsoon  as  he  realized  that  he  was  an \nenemy  of  GOD,  he  disowned  him. \nAbraham  was  extremely  kind,  cle-\nment. \n\n115.

This \nphenomenon has puzzled the students of the Quran for 14 centuries, and many theories \nwere  advanced  to  explain  it.  Now  we  realize  that  the  conspicuous  absence  of  the \nBasmalah serves three purposes: (1) It represents an advance divine proclamation that \nthe idol worshipers were destined to tamper with the Quran by adding 2 false verses \n(9:128-129). (2) It demonstrates one of the functions of God\u2019s mathematical code in \nthe Quran, namely, to guard the Quran against any alteration. (3) It provides additional \nmiraculous features of the Quran\u2019s code. Due to their extraordinary importance, the \ndetails are given in Appendices 24 and 29. One immediate observation is that the number \nof occurrences of the word \u201cGod\u201d at the end of Sura 9 is 1273 (19x67). If the two false \nverses 128 & 129 are included, this phenomenon \u2212 and many more \u2212 will vanish. \n\n*10:1 These letters constitute a major portion of the Quran\u2019s awesome mathematical \ncode and proof of divine authorship.

On  the  day  when  we  summon  them \nall,  we  will say  to  those  who  wor-\nshiped  idols,  \u201cWe  have  summoned \nyou,  together  with  your  idols.\u201d  We \nwill have them confront each other, \n\nJonah (Younus) 10:24-35 \n\nand  their  idols  will  say  to  them,  \u201cWe \nhad no idea that you idolized us. \n29.  \u201cGOD  suffices  as  a  witness  between \nus  and  you,  that  we  were  completely \nunaware of your worshiping us.\u201d \n30.  That  is  when  each  soul  will  examine \neverything  it  had  done.  They  will  be \nreturned  to  GOD,  their  rightful \nLord  and  Master,  and  the  idols  they \nhad fabricated will disown them. \n31.  Say,  \u201cWho  provides  for  you  from \nthe  heaven  and  the  earth?  Who  con-\ntrols  all  the  hearing  and  the  eye-\nsight?  Who  produces  the  living  from \nthe  dead,  and  the  dead  from  the \nliving?  Who  is  in  control  of  all \nthings?\u201d  They  would  say,  \u201cGOD.\u201d \nSay,  \u201cWhy  then  do  you  not  observe \nthe commandments?\u201d \n\n32.  Such  is  GOD,  your  rightful  Lord. \nWhat  is  there  after  the  truth,  except \nfalsehood?  How  could  you  dis-\nregard all this? \n\n33.  This  is  what  your  Lord\u2019s  decision \ndoes  to  those  who  choose  to  be \nwicked: they cannot believe. \n\nReflect on Your Idols \n34.  Say,  \u201cCan  any  of  your  idols  initiate \ncreation,  then  repeat  it?\u201d  Say, \n\u201cGOD  initiates  the  creation,  then \nrepeats it.\u201d \n\n35.  Say,  \u201cDoes  any  of  your  idols  guide \nto  the  truth?\u201d  Say,  \u201cGOD  guides  to \nthe  truth.  Is  one  who  guides  to  the \ntruth  more  worthy  of  being  fol-\nlowed,  or  one  who  does  not  guide, \nand  needs  guidance  for  himself? \nWhat  is  wrong  with  your  judg-\nment?\u201d \n\n*10:24 God, of course, knows whether His judgment will come during the day, or during  \nthe night.

Do  not  have  any  doubt  regarding \nwhat  these  people  worship;  they \nworship  exactly  as  they  found  their \nparents  worshiping.  We  will  requite \nthem  their  due  share  fully,  without \nreduction. \n\n110.  We  have  given  Moses  the  scripture, \nbut  it  was  disputed,  and  if  it  were  not \nfor  a  predetermined  word  decreed \nby  your  Lord,  they  would  have  been \njudged  immediately.  They  are  full  of \ndoubt about this, suspicious. \n\n111.  Your  Lord  will  surely  recompense \neveryone  for  their  works.  He  is  fully \nCognizant of everything they do. \n112.  Therefore,  continue  on  the  path  you \nhave  been  enjoined  to  follow,  to-\ngether  with  those  who  repented  with \nyou,  and  do  not  transgress.  He  is \nSeer of everything you do. \n\n113.  Do  not  lean  towards  those  who  have \ntransgressed,  lest  you  incur  Hell, \nand  find  no  allies  to  help  you  against \nGOD, then end up losers. \n\nThree of the Five Prayers \n\n114.  You  shall  observe  the  Contact \nPrayers  (Salat)  at  both  ends  of  the \nday,  and  during  the  night.  The  right-\neous  works  wipe  out  the  evil  works. \nThis  is  a  reminder  for  those  who \nwould take heed. \n\n115.  You  shall  steadfastly  persevere,  for \nGOD  never  fails  to  recompense  the \nrighteous. \n\n116.  If  only  some  of  those  among  the \nprevious  generations  possessed \nenough  intelligence  to  forbid  evil! \nOnly  a  few  of  them  deserved  to  be \nsaved  by  us.  As  for  the  transgres-\nsors,  they  were  preoccupied  with \ntheir  material  luxuries;  they  were \nguilty. \n\n117.

Recall that Joseph said to his father, \n\u201cO my father, I saw eleven planets, \nand  the  sun,  and  the  moon;  I  saw \nthem prostrating before me.\u201d \n\n5.  He said, \u201cMy son, do not tell your \nbrothers about your dream, lest they \nplot and scheme against you. Surely, \nthe devil is man\u2019s worst enemy. \n6.  \u201cYour Lord has thus blessed you, \nand has given you good news \n\nthrough  your  dream.  He  has  per-\nfected His blessings upon you and \nupon the family of Jacob, as He did \nfor  your  ancestors  Abraham  and \nIsaac before that. Your Lord is Om-\nniscient, Most Wise. \n\n7.  In Joseph and his brothers there are \n\nlessons for the seekers. \n\n8.  They said, \u201cJoseph and his brother \nare favored by our father, and we \nare  in  the  majority.  Indeed,  our \nfather is far astray. \n\nJoseph\u2019s Fate \nAlready Decided by God* \n9.  \u201cLet us kill Joseph, or banish him, \nthat you  may get some  attention \nfrom your father. Afterwards, you \ncan be righteous people.\u201d* \n\n10.  One  of  them  said,  \u201cDo  not  kill \nJoseph; let us throw him into the \nabyss  of  the  well.  Perhaps  some \ncaravan can pick him up, if this is \nwhat you decide to do.\u201d \n\n11.  They said, \u201cOur father, why do you \nnot trust us with Joseph? We will \ntake good care of him. \n\n12.  \u201cSend him with us tomorrow to run \nand play. We will protect him.\u201d \n13.  He said, \u201cI worry lest you go away \nwith him, then the wolf may devour \nhim while you are not watching \nhim.\u201d \n\n14.

See 41:44 and Appendix 4. \n*12:9 We learn from Joseph\u2019s dream that he was destined for a bright future. Thus, while \nhis brothers met to decide his fate, his fate was already decided by God.

May \nGOD  help  me  in  the  face  of  your \nconspiracy.\u201d \n\nJoseph is Taken to Egypt \n\n19.  A  caravan  passed  by,  and  soon  sent \ntheir  waterer.  He  let  down  his  buck-   \net,  then  said,  \u201cHow  lucky!  There  is \na  boy  here!\u201d  They  took  him  along  as \nmerchandise,  and  GOD  was  fully \naware of what they did. \n\n20.

The  one  who  bought  him  in  Egypt \nsaid  to  his  wife,  \u201cTake  good  care  of \nhim.  Maybe  he  can  help  us,  or \nmaybe  we  can  adopt  him.\u201d  We  thus \nestablished  Joseph  on  earth,  and  we \ntaught  him  the  interpretation  of \ndreams.  GOD\u2019s  command  is  always \ndone, but most people do not know. \n\n22.  When  he  reached  maturity,  we  en-\ndowed  him  with  wisdom  and  knowl-\nedge. We thus reward the righteous. \n\nGod Protects the Believers \nFrom Sin \n\n23.  The  lady  of  the  house  where  he  lived \ntried  to  seduce  him.  She  closed  the \ndoors  and  said,  \u201cI  am  all  yours.\u201d  He \nsaid,  \u201cMay  GOD  protect  me.  He  is \nmy  Lord,  who  gave  me  a  good \nhome.*  The  transgressors  never \nsucceed.\u201d \n\n24.  She  almost  succumbed  to  him,  and \nhe  almost  succumbed  to  her,  if  it \nwere  not  that  he  saw  a  proof  from \nhis  Lord.  We  thus  diverted  evil  and \nsin away from him, for he was one of \nour devoted servants. \n\n25.  The  two  of  them  raced  towards  the \ndoor,  and,  in  the  process,  she  tore \nhis  garment  from  the  back.  They \nfound  her  husband  at  the  door.  She \nsaid,  \u201cWhat  should  be  the  punish-\nment  for  one  who  wanted  to  molest \nyour  wife,  except  imprisonment  or  a \npainful punishment?\u201d \n\n26.  He  said,  \u201cShe  is  the  one  who  tried \nto  seduce  me.\u201d  A  witness  from  her \nfamily  suggested:  \u201cIf  his  garment  is \ntorn  from  the  front,  then  she  is  tell- \ning the truth and he is a liar. \n\n27.  \u201cAnd  if  his  garment  is  torn  from  the \nback,  then  she  lied,  and  he  is  telling \nthe truth.\u201d \n\n28.  When  her  husband  saw  that  his  gar-\nment  was  torn  from  the  back,  he \nsaid,  \u201cThis  is  a  woman\u2019s  scheme. \nIndeed,  your  scheming  is  formid-\nable. \n\n* 12:23 Joseph worded this statement in such a way that the governor\u2019s wife thought that   \nhe was talking about her husband, when in fact he was talking about God. \n\n1376 \n\n83356 \n\n \n\f"

This  is  some  of  the \nknowledge  bestowed  upon  me  by \nmy  Lord.

In GOD all \nthe trusters shall trust.\u201d \n\n13.  Those who disbelieved said to their \nmessengers, \u201cWe will banish you \nfrom our land, unless you revert to \nour religion.\u201d Their Lord inspired \nthem: \u201cWe will inevitably annihilate \nthe transgressors. \n\n14.  \u201cAnd we will let you dwell in their \nland after them.

You shall not violate the oaths \nafter swearing (by God) to carry \nthem out, for you have made GOD a \nguarantor  for  you.  GOD  knows \neverything you do. \n\n92.  Do not be like the knitter who un-\nravels her strong knitting into piles \nof flimsy yarn. This is your example \nif you abuse the oaths to take ad-\nvantage  of  one  another.  Whether \none group is larger than the other, \nGOD thus puts you to the test. He \nwill surely show you on the Day of \nResurrection  everything  you  had \ndisputed. \n\n93.  Had  GOD  willed,  He  could  have \nmade you one congregation. But He \nsends astray whoever chooses to go \nastray, and He guides whoever wish-\nes to be guided.* You will surely be \nasked  about  everything  you  have \ndone. \n\nViolating Your Oath:     \nA Serious Offense \n94.  Do not abuse the oaths among you, \nlest you slide back after having a \nstrong  foothold,  then  you  incur \nmisery. Such is the consequence of \nrepelling from the path of GOD (by \nsetting  a  bad  example);  you  incur  a \nterrible retribution. \n\n95.  Do not sell your oaths before GOD \nshort.

His  power  is  limited  to  those  who \nchoose  him  as  their  master;  those \nwho choose him as their god. \n101.  When  we  substitute  one  revelation \nin place of another, and GOD is fully \naware  of  what  He  reveals,  they  say, \n\u201cYou  made  this  up!\u201d  Indeed,  most \nof them do not know. \n\n102.  Say,  \u201cThe  Holy  Spirit  has  brought  it \ndown  from  your  Lord,  truthfully,  to \nassure  those  who  believe,  and  to \nprovide  a  beacon  and  good  news  for \nthe submitters.\u201d \n\nThe Quran Is Not Copied \nFrom The Bible \n\n103.  We  are  fully  aware  that  they  say,  \u201cA \nhuman being is teaching him!\u201d The \n\ntongue  of  the  source  they  hint  at  is \nnon-Arabic,  and  this  is  a  perfect \nArabic tongue. \n\n104.  Surely,  those  who  do  not  believe  in \nGOD\u2019s  revelations,  GOD  does  not \nguide  them.  They  have  incurred  a \npainful retribution. \n\n105.  The  only  ones  who  fabricate  false \ndoctrines  are  those  who  do  not \nbelieve  in  GOD\u2019s  revelations;  they \nare the real liars. \n\nLip Service Does Not Count \n\n106.  Those  who  disbelieve  in  GOD,  after \nhaving  acquired  faith,  and  become \nfully  content  with  disbelief,  have  in-\ncurred  wrath  from  GOD.  The  only \nones  to  be  excused  are  those  who \nare  forced  to  profess  disbelief,  while \ntheir hearts are full of faith.* \n\n Preoccupation With This Life \nLeads to Exile From God \n\n107.  This  is  because  they  have  given \npriority  to  this  life  over  the  Here-\nafter,  and  GOD  does  not  guide  such \ndisbelieving people. \n\n108.  Those  are  the  ones  whom  GOD  has \nsealed  their  hearts,  and  their  hear- \ning,  and  their  eyesight.  Consequent-  \nly, they remain unaware. \n\n109.  Without  a  doubt,  they  will  be  the \n\nlosers in the Hereafter. \n\n110.  As  for  those  who  emigrate  because \nof  persecution,  then  continue  to \nstrive  and  steadfastly  persevere, \nyour  Lord,  because  of  all  this,  is \nForgiver, Most Merciful. \n\n*16:98 Our salvation is attained by knowing God\u2019s message to us, the Quran, and Satan \nwill do his utmost to keep us from being redeemed. Hence this commandment. \n*16:106 God\u2019s wisdom decrees that if someone holds a gun to your head and orders \nyou to declare that you disbelieve in God, you may grant him his wish.

Consequently,  GOD \ncaused them to taste the hardships \nof starvation and insecurity. Such is \nthe requital for what they did. \n113.

The human being often prays for \nsomething that may hurt him, think-\ning that he is praying for something \ngood. The human being is impa-\ntient. \n\n12.

You shall not set up any other god \nbeside GOD, lest you end up de-\nspised and disgraced. \n\n23.

He  said, \n\u201cShall  I  prostrate  to  one  You  cre-\nated from mud?\u201d \n\n62.  He  said,  \u201cSince  You  have  honored \nhim  over  me,  if  You  respite  me  till \nthe  Day  of  Resurrection,  I  will  pos-\nsess  all  his  descendants,  except  a \nfew.\u201d \n\n63.  He  said,  \u201cThen  go;  you  and  those \nwho follow you will end up in Hell \nas  your  requital;  an  equitable  requi-   \ntal. \n\n64.  \u201cYou  may  entice  them  with  your \nvoice,  and  mobilize  all  your  forces \nand  all  your  men  against  them,  and \nshare  in  their  money  and  children, \nand  promise  them.  Anything  the \ndevil  promises  is  no  more  than  an \nillusion. \n\n169 \n65.  \u201cAs  for  My  servants,  you  have  no \npower  over  them.\u201d  Your  Lord  suf-\nfices as an advocate. \n\n66.  Your  Lord  is  the  One  who  causes \nthe  ships  to  float  on  the  ocean,*  that \nyou  may  seek  His  bounties.  He  is \nMost Merciful towards you. \n\nBad Weather \nFriends \n\n67.  If  you  are  afflicted  in  the  middle  of \nthe  sea,  you  forget  your  idols  and \nsincerely  implore  Him  alone.  But  as \nsoon  as  He  saves  you  to  the  shore, \nyou  revert.  Indeed,  the  human  being \nis unappreciative. \n\n68.  Have  you  guaranteed  that  He  will \nnot  cause  the  land,  on  shore,  to  swal-\nlow  you?  Or,  that  He  will  not  send \nupon  you  a  tempest,  then  you  find \nno protector? \n\n69.  Have  you  guaranteed  that  He  will \nnot  return  you  to  the  sea  another \ntime,  then  send  upon  you  a  storm \nthat  drowns  you  because  of  your  dis-\nbelief?  Once  this  happens,  we  will \nnot give you another chance. \n\n70.  We  have  honored  the  children  of \nAdam,  and  provided  them  with \nrides  on  land  and  in  the  sea.  We \nprovided  for  them  good  provisions, \nand  we  gave  them  greater  ad-\nvantages  than  many  of  our  crea-\ntures. \n\n71.  The  day  will  come  when  we  sum-\nmon  every  people,  together  with \ntheir  record.  As  for  those  who  are \ngiven  a  record  of  righteousness,  they \nwill  read  their  record  and  will  not \nsuffer the least injustice. \n\n*17:60 Muhammad\u2019s journey to the highest heaven to receive the Quran, as stated in \n17:1 and 53:1-18, is a test because the people had to believe Muhammad on faith. \n*17:66 We now learn from physics and physical chemistry that water possesses unique \nqualities that render it perfectly suitable for serving our various needs. \n1576 \n\n91625 \n\n \n\f"

As  for  those  who  are  blind  in  this \nlife,  they  will  be  blind  in  the  Here-\nafter; even a lot worse. \n\n81.  Proclaim,  \u201cThe  truth  has  prevailed, \nand  falsehood  has  vanished;  false-\nhood will inevitably vanish.\u201d \n\nGod Strengthens the Messenger \n\n73.  They  almost  diverted  you  from  the \nrevelations  we  have  given  you.  They \nwanted  you  to  fabricate  something \nelse,  in  order  to  consider  you  a \nfriend. \n\n74.  If  it  were  not  that  we  strengthened \nyou,  you  almost  leaned  towards \nthem just a little bit. \n\n75.  Had  you  done  that,  we  would  have \ndoubled  the  retribution  for  you  in \nthis  life,  and  after  death,  and  you \nwould  have  found  no  one  to  help  you \nagainst us. \n\n76.  They  almost  banished  you  from  the \nland  to  get  rid  of  you,  so  they  could \nrevert as soon as you left. \n\n77.  This  has  been  consistently  the  case \nwith  all  the  messengers  that  we  sent \nbefore  you,  and  you  will  find  that \nour system never changes. \n\nThe Noon Prayer \n\n78.  You  shall  observe  the  Contact \nPrayer  (Salat)  when  the  sun  de-\nclines  from  its  highest  point  at  noon, \nas  it  moves  towards  sunset.  You \nshall  also  observe  (the  recitation  of) \nthe  Quran  at  dawn.  (Reciting)  the \nQuran at dawn is witnessed. \n\nMeditation \n\n79.  During  the  night,  you  shall  meditate \nfor  extra  credit,  that  your  Lord  may \nraise you to an honorable rank. \n\n80.  And  say,  \u201cMy  Lord,  admit  me  an \nhonorable  admittance,  and  let  me \ndepart  an  honorable  departure,  and \ngrant  me  from  You  a  powerful  sup-\nport.\u201d \n\nHealing and Mercy \n\n82.  We  send  down  in  the  Quran  healing \nand  mercy  for  the  believers.  At  the \nsame  time,  it  only  increases  the \nwickedness of the transgressors. \n83.  When  we  bless  the  human  being,  he \nbecomes  preoccupied  and  heedless. \nBut  when  adversity  strikes  him,  he \nturns despondent. \n\n84.  Say,  \u201cEveryone  works  in  accord-\nance  with  his  belief,  and  your  Lord \nknows  best  which  ones  are  guided  in \nthe right path.\u201d \n\nDivine Revelation:           \n\nThe Source of All Knowledge \n85.  They  ask  you  about  the  revelation. \nSay,  \u201cThe  revelation  comes  from  my \nLord.  The  knowledge  given  to  you  is \nminute.\u201d \n\n86.  If we will, we can take back what we \nrevealed  to  you,  then you  will  find  no \nprotector against us. \n\n87.  This  is  but  mercy  from  your  Lord. \nHis  blessings  upon  you  have  been \ngreat. \n\nMathematical Composition       \nof  the Quran \n\n88.

Could they not see that the GOD \nwho created the heavens and the \nearth, is able to create the same \ncreations?  He  has  predetermined \nfor them an irrevocable life span? \nYet, the disbelievers insist upon dis-\nbelieving. \n\n100.  Proclaim,  \u201cIf  you  possessed  my \nLord\u2019s treasures of mercy, you \nwould have withheld them, fearing \nthat you might exhaust them. The \nhuman being is stingy.\u201d \n\nMoses and Pharaoh \n\n101.  We  supported  Moses  with  nine \nprofound miracles\u2014ask the Children \nof  Israel.  When  he  went  to \nthem, Pharaoh said to him, \u201cI think \nthat you, Moses, are bewitched.\u201d \n102.  He said, \u201cYou know full well that no \none can manifest these except, ob-\nviously, the Lord of the heavens and \nthe earth. I think that you, Pharaoh, \nare doomed.\u201d \n\n103.

Why  else  do  you  think  we  are  telling \nyou  about  the  people  of  the  cave, \nand  the  numbers  connected  with \nthem?  They  are  among  our  won-\ndrous signs. \n\n10.  When  the  youths  took  refuge  in  the \ncave,  they  said,  \u201cOur  Lord,  shower \nus  with  Your  mercy,  and  bless  our \naffairs with Your guidance.\u201d \n\n11.  We  then  sealed  their  ears  in  the \ncave  for  a  predetermined  number  of \nyears. \n\n12.  Then  we  resurrected  them  to  see \nwhich  of  the  two  parties  could  count \nthe duration of their stay therein. \n13.  We  narrate  to  you  their  history, \ntruthfully.  They  were  youths  who \nbelieved  in  their  Lord,  and  we  in- \ncreased their guidance. \n\n14.

The role   \nof these believers in unveiling the end of the world is detailed in Appendix 25. \n\n*18:16-20 Ephesus is located about 200 miles south of ancient Nicene, and 30 miles \nsouth of today\u2019s Izmir in Turkey. The dwellers of the cave were young Christians who \nwanted to follow the teachings of Jesus, and worship God alone. They were fleeing the \npersecution of neo-Christians who proclaimed a corrupted Christianity three centuries \nafter Jesus, following the Nicene Conferences, when the Trinity doctrine was announced.      \nIn  1928,  Franz  Miltner,  an  Austrian  archeologist  discovered  the  tomb  of  the  seven \nsleepers of Ephesus.

Once,  after  harvesting,  he  boastful-    \nly  told  his  friend:  \u201cI  am  far  more \nprosperous  than  you,  and  I  com-\nmand  more  respect  from  the  peo-\nple.\u201d \n\n35.  When  he  entered  his  garden,  he \nwronged  his  soul  by  saying,  \u201cI  do  not \nthink that this will ever end. \n\n36.  \u201cMoreover,  I  think  this  is  it;  I  do  not \nthink  that  the  Hour  (the  Hereafter) \nwill ever come to pass. Even if I am \nreturned  to  my  Lord,  I  will  (be  clever \nenough  to)  possess  an  even  better \none over there.\u201d \n\n37.  His  friend  said  to  him,  as  he  de-\nbated  with  him,  \u201cHave  you  dis-\nbelieved  in  the  One  who  created  you \nfrom  dust,  then  from  a  tiny  drop, \nthen perfected you into a man? \n\n38.  \u201cAs  for  me,  GOD  is  my  Lord,  and  I \nwill  never  set  up  any  other  god  be-\nsides my Lord. \n\nImportant Commandment \n39.  \u201cWhen  you  entered  your  garden, \nyou  should  have  said,  This  is  what \nGOD  has  given  me  (M\u00e3  Sh\u00e3  All\u00e3h). \nNo  one  possesses  power  except \nGOD  (L\u00e3  Quwwata  Ell\u00e3  Bell\u00e3h).\u2019 \nYou  may  see  that  I  possess  less \nmoney and less children than you. \n40.  \u201cMy  Lord  may  grant  me  better  than \nyour  garden.  He  may  send  a  violent \nstorm  from  the  sky  that  wipes  out \nyour  garden,  leaving  it  completely \nbarren. \n\n41.  \u201cOr,  its  water  may  sink  deeper,  out \n\nof your reach.\u201d \n\n42.  Indeed,  his  crops  were  wiped  out, \nand  he  ended  up  sorrowful,  lament-  \ning  what  he  had  spent  on  it  in  vain, \nas  his  property  lay  barren.  He  finally \nsaid,  \u201cI  wish  I  never  set  up  my \nproperty as a god beside my Lord.\u201d \n\n*18:32-42 The Quran cites many examples of the different gods that people worship \nbeside  God;  they  include  children  (7:190),  religious  leaders  and  scholars  (9:31), \nproperty (18:42), dead saints and prophets (16:20-21, 35:14, & 46:5-6), and the ego \n(25:43, 45:23). \n1595 \n\n 92525 \n\n \n \n\f"

That is because the only true Lord \nand master is GOD; He provides the \nbest recompense, and with Him is \nthe best destiny. \n\n45.  Cite for them the example of this life \nas water that we send down from the \nsky to produce plants of the earth, \nthen they turn into hay that is blown \naway by the wind. GOD is able to do \nall things. \n\nRearranging Our Priorities \n\n46.  Money and children are the joys of \nthis life, but the righteous works \nprovide  an  eternal  recompense \nfrom your Lord, and a far better \nhope. \n\n47.  The day will come when we wipe out \nthe mountains, and you will see the \nearth barren. We will summon them \nall, not leaving out a single one of \nthem. \n\n48.  They will be presented before your \nLord in a row. You have come to us \nas individuals, just as we created you \ninitially. Indeed, this is what you \nclaimed will never happen. \n\n49.  The record will be shown, and you \nwill see the guilty fearful of its con-\ntents. They will say, \u201cWoe to us. \nHow come this book leaves nothing, \nsmall or large, without counting it?\u201d \nThey will find everything they had \ndone brought forth. Your Lord is \nnever unjust towards anyone. \n\nClassification of God\u2019s Creatures \n50.  We said to the angels, \u201cFall pros-\ntrate before Adam.\u201d They fell pros-\ntrate, except Satan. He became a \njinn, for he disobeyed the order of \nHis Lord.* Will you choose him and \nhis descendants as lords instead of \nMe, even though they are your ene-\nmies? What a miserable substitute! \n51.  I never permitted them to witness \nthe creation of the heavens and the \nearth,  nor  the  creation  of  them-\nselves. Nor do I permit the wicked \nto work in My kingdom.* \n\n52.  The day will come when He says, \n\u201cCall upon My partners, whom you \nclaimed to be gods beside Me;\u201d they \nwill call on them, but they will not \nrespond to  them.  An insurmount-\nable barrier will separate them from \neach other. \n\n53.  The guilty will see Hell, and will \nrealize that they will fall into it. They \nwill have no escape therefrom. \n\nDisbelievers Refuse to Accept the \nCompleteness of the Quran \n\n54.  We have cited in this Quran every \nkind of example,  but  the human \nbeing  is  the  most  argumentative \ncreature. \n\n55.  Nothing prevented the people from \nbelieving, when the guidance came \nto them, and from seeking the for-\ngiveness of their Lord, except that \nthey  demanded  to  see  the  same \n(kind of miracles) as the previous \ngenerations,  or  challenged  to  see \nthe retribution beforehand. \n\n*18:50 When the great feud in the heavenly society took place (38:69), all creatures \nbecame classified into angels, jinns, and humans (Appendix 7). \n\n*18:51 God knew that Satan and his supporters (jinns and humans) were going to make \nthe wrong decision. Hence their exclusion from witnessing the creation process. \n\n1598 \n\n92657 \n\n \n\f"

Those  who  dis-\nbelieve  argue  with  falsehood  to \ndefeat  the  truth,  and  they  take  My \nproofs and warnings in vain. \n\nDivine Intervention \n\n57.

Many  a  community  we  annihilated \nbecause  of  their  transgressions,  we \ndesignated  a  specific  time  for  their \nannihilation. \n\nValuable Lessons from Moses  \nand His Teacher \n\n60.  Moses  said  to  his  servant,  \u201cI  will  not \nrest  until  I  reach  the  point  where  the \ntwo  rivers  meet,  no  matter  how  long \nit takes.\u201d \n\n61.  When  they  reached  the  point  where \nthey  met,  they  forgot  their  fish,  and \nit  found  its  way  back  to  the  river, \nsneakily. \n\n62.  After  they  passed  that  point,  he  said \nto  his  servant,  \u201cLet  us  have  lunch. \nAll  this  traveling  has  thoroughly  ex-\nhausted us.\u201d \n\n63.  He  said,  \u201cRemember  when  we  sat \nby  the  rock  back  there?  I  paid  no \nattention  to  the  fish.  It  was  the  devil \nwho  made  me  forget  it,  and  it  found \nits way back to the river, strangely.\u201d \n64.  (Moses)  said,  \u201cThat  was  the  place \nwe  were  looking  for.\u201d  They  traced \ntheir steps back. \n\n65.  They  found  one  of  our  servants, \nwhom  we  blessed  with  mercy,  and \nbestowed  upon  him  from  our  own \nknowledge. \n\n66.  Moses  said  to  him,  \u201cCan  I  follow \nyou,  that  you  may  teach  me  some  of \nthe  knowledge  and  the  guidance  be-\nstowed upon you?\u201d \n\n67.  He  said,  \u201cYou  cannot  stand  to  be \n\nwith me. \n\n68.  \u201cHow  can  you  stand  that  which  you \n\ndo not comprehend?\u201d \n\n69.  He  said,  \u201cYou  will  find  me,  GOD \nwilling,  patient.  I  will  not  disobey \nany command you give me.\u201d \n\n70.  He  said,  \u201cIf  you  follow  me,  then  you \nshall  not  ask  me  about  anything,  un- \nless I choose to tell you about it.\u201d \n71.  So  they  went.  When  they  boarded  a \nship,  he  bore  a  hole  in  it.  He  said, \n\u201cDid  you  bore  a  hole  in  it  to  drown \nits  people?  You  have  committed \nsomething terrible.\u201d \n\n72.  He  said,  \u201cDid  I  not  say  that  you \n\ncannot stand to be with me?\u201d \n\n73.  He  said,  \u201cI  am  sorry.  Do  not  punish \nme  for  my  forgetfulness;  do  not  be \ntoo harsh with me.\u201d \n\n74.  So  they  went.  When  they  met  a \nyoung  boy,  he  killed  him.  He  said, \n\u201cWhy  did  you  kill  such  an  innocent \nsoul,  who  did  not  kill  another  soul? \nYou  have  committed  something \nhorrendous.\u201d \n\n1599 \n\n92726 \n\n \n \n \n\f"

Under  it, \nthere  was  a  treasure  that  belonged \nto  them.  Because  their  father  was  a \nrighteous  man,  your  Lord  wanted \nthem  to  grow  up  and  attain  full \nstrength,  then  extract  their  treasure. \nSuch is mercy from your Lord.

We  granted  him  authority  on  earth, \nand  provided  him  with  all  kinds  of \nmeans. \n\n85.  Then, he pursued one way. \n86.  When  he  reached  the  far  west,  he \nfound  the  sun  setting  in  a  vast  ocean, \nand  found  people  there.  We  said, \n\u201cO  Zul-Qarnain,  you  can  rule  as  you \nwish;  either  punish,  or  be  kind  to \nthem.\u201d \n\n87.

They  said,  \u201cO  Mary,  you  have \ncommitted  something  that  is  totally \nunexpected. \n\n28.  \u201cO  descendant  of  Aaron,  your  fa-\nther  was  not  a  bad  man,  nor  was \nyour mother unchaste.\u201d \n\nThe Infant Makes a Statement \n29.  She  pointed  to  him.  They  said, \n\u201cHow  can  we  talk  with  an  infant  in \nthe crib?\u201d \n\n30.  (The  infant  spoke  and)  said,  \u201cI  am  a \nservant  of  GOD.  He  has  given  me \nthe  scripture,  and  has  appointed  me \na prophet. \n\n31.  \u201cHe  made  me  blessed  wherever  I \ngo,  and  enjoined  me  to  observe \nthe  Contact  Prayers  (Salat)  and  the \nobligatory  charity  (Zakat)  for  as \nlong as I live. \n\n32.  \u201cI  am  to  honor  my  mother;  He  did \nnot make me a disobedient rebel. \n33.  \u201cAnd  peace  be  upon  me  the  day  I \nwas  born,  the  day  I  die,  and  the  day \nI get resurrected.\u201d \n\nThe Proven Truth \n34.  That  was  Jesus,  the  son  of  Mary, \nand  this  is  the  truth  of  this  matter, \nabout which they continue to doubt. \n35.  It  does  not  befit  GOD  that  He  be-\ngets  a  son,  be  He  glorified.  To  have \nanything  done,  He  simply  says  to  it, \n\u201cBe,\u201d and it is. \n\n36.  He  also  proclaimed,  \u201cGOD  is  my \nLord  and  your  Lord;  you  shall  wor-\nship  Him  alone.  This  is  the  right \npath.\u201d* \n\n37.  The  various  parties  disputed  among \nthemselves  (regarding  the  identity  of \nJesus).  Therefore,  woe  to  those  who \ndisbelieve  from  the  sight  of  a  ter-\nrible day. \n\n38.  Wait  till  you  hear  them  and  see \nthem  when  they  come  to  face  us. \nThe  transgressors  on  that  day  will  be \ntotally lost. \n\n39.  Warn  them  about  the  day  of  re-\nmorse,  when  judgment  will  be  is-\nsued.  They  are  totally  oblivious;  they \ndo not believe. \n\n40.  We  are  the  ones  who  inherit  the \nearth  and  everyone  on  it;  to  us \neveryone will be returned. \n\nAbraham \n\n41.  Mention  in  the  scripture  Abraham; \n\nhe was a saint, a prophet. \n\n*19:25 Thus, Jesus was born in late September or early October. This is when dates ripen \nin the Middle East to the point of falling off the tree. \n*19:36 This is similar to the statement attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John 20:17. \n92827 \n1602 \n\n \n \n\f"

And  mention  in  the  scripture  Is-\nmail.  He  was  truthful  when  he  made \na  promise,  and  he  was  a  messenger \nprophet. \n\n55.  He  used  to  enjoin  his  family  to  ob-\nserve  the  Contact  Prayers  (Salat) \nand  the  obligatory  charity  (Zakat); \nhe was acceptable to his Lord. \n\n56.  And  mention  in  the  scripture  Idr\u00ees. \n\nHe was a saint, a prophet. \n\n57.  We  raised  him  to  an  honorable \n\nrank. \n\n58.  These  are  some  of  the  prophets \nwhom  GOD  blessed.

What  they  fabricated  is \nno  more  than  the  scheming  of  a \nmagician.  The  magician\u2019s  work  will \nnot succeed.\u201d \n\nThe Experts Recognize The Truth \n70.  The  magicians  fell  prostrate,  saying, \n\u201cWe  believe  in  the  Lord  of  Aaron \nand Moses.\u201d \n\n71.  He  said,  \u201cDid  you  believe  in  him \nwithout  my  permission?  He  must  be \nyour  chief;  the  one  who  taught  you \nmagic. I will surely sever your hands \n\nand  feet  on  alternate  sides.  I  will \ncrucify  you  on  the  palm  trunks.  You \nwill  find  out  which  of  us  can  inflict \nthe  worst  retribution,  and  who  out-       \nlasts whom.\u201d \n\n72.  They  said,  \u201cWe  will  not  prefer  you \nover  the  clear  proofs  that  came  to \nus,  and  over  the  One  who  created \nus.  Therefore,  issue  whatever  judg-\nment you wish to issue. You can only \nrule in this lowly life. \n\n73.  \u201cWe  have  believed  in  our  Lord,  that \nHe  may  forgive  us  our  sins,  and  the \nmagic  that  you  forced  us  to  perform. \nGOD is far better and Everlasting.\u201d \n74.  Anyone  who  comes  to  his  Lord \nguilty  will  incur  Hell,  wherein  he \nnever dies, nor stays alive. \n\n75.  As  for  those  who  come  to  Him  as \nbelievers  who  had  led  a  righteous \nlife, they attain the high ranks. \n\n76. The  gardens  of  Eden,  beneath \nwhich  rivers  flow,  will  be  their  abode \nforever.  Such  is  the  reward  for  those \nwho purify themselves. \n\n77.  We  inspired  Moses:  \u201cLead  My  ser-\nvants  out,  and  strike  for  them  a  dry \nroad  across  the  sea.  You  shall  not \nfear  that  you  may  get  caught,  nor \nshall you worry.\u201d \n\n78.  Pharaoh  pursued  them  with  his \ntroops,  but  the  sea  overwhelmed \nthem,  as  it  was  destined  to  over-\nwhelm them. \n\n79.  Thus,  Pharaoh  misled  his  people; \n\nhe did not guide them. \n\n80.  O  Children  of  Israel,  we  delivered \nyou  from  your  enemy,  summoned \nyou  to  the  right  side  of  Mount  Sinai, \nand  we  sent  down  to  you  manna  and \nquails. \n\n 1611 \n\n 93295 \n\n \n\f"

O people, you shall reverence your \nLord, for the quaking of the Hour is \nsomething horrendous. \n\n2.  The day you witness it, even a nurs-\ning mother will discard her infant, \nand a pregnant woman will abort \nher fetus. You will see the people \nstaggering, as if they are intoxicated, \neven though they are not intoxi-\ncated. This is because, GOD\u2019s retri-\nbution is so awesome. \n\n3.  Among the people, there are those \nwho  argue  about  GOD  without \nknowledge, and follow every rebel-\nlious devil. \n\n4.  It is decreed that anyone who allies \nhimself with him, he will mislead \nhim and guide him to the agony of \nHell. \n\nWhere Did We Come From? \n\n5.  O people, if you have any doubt \nabout  resurrection,  (remember  that) \nwe created you from dust, and sub-\nsequently from a tiny drop, which \nturns into a hanging (embryo), then \nit becomes a fetus that is given life \nor deemed lifeless. We thus clarify \nthings for you. We settle in the \nwombs whatever we will for a pre-\ndetermined period.* We then bring \nyou out as infants, then you reach \nmaturity. While some of you die \nyoung, others live to the worst age, \nonly to find out that no more knowl- \n\nedge can be attained beyond a cer-\ntain limit. Also, you look at a land \nthat  is  dead,  then  as  soon  as  we \nshower it with water, it vibrates with \nlife and grows all kinds of beautiful \nplants. \n\n6.  This proves that GOD is the Truth, \nand that He revives the dead, and \nthat He is Omnipotent. \n\n7.  And  that the Hour is  coming, no \ndoubt about it, and that GOD resur-\nrects those who are in the graves. \n\nA Common Occurrence \n8.  Among the people there is the one \nwho  argues  about  GOD  without \nknowledge,  and  without  guidance, \nand without an enlightening scrip-\nture. \n\n9.  Arrogantly he strives to divert the \npeople from the path of GOD. He \nthus incurs humiliation in this life, \nand we commit him on the Day of \nResurrection to the agony of burn-\ning. \n\n10.  This is what your hands have sent \nahead for you. GOD is never unjust \ntowards the people. \n\nFair Weather Friends \n\n11.  Among the people there is the one \nwho worships GOD conditionally. If \nthings go his way, he is content. But \nif some adversity befalls him, he \nmakes an about-face. Thus, he loses \nboth this  life and the Hereafter. \nSuch is the real loss. \n\n12.  He idolizes beside GOD what pos-\nsesses no power to harm him or \nbenefit him; such is the real straying. \n\n*22:5 The Quran\u2019s mathematical miracle is based on the number 19. As it turns out, \nthis number represents the Creator\u2019s signature on His creations. Thus, you and I have \n209 bones in our bodies (209=19x11).

They  will \nbe  adorned  therein  with  bracelets  of \ngold,  and  pearls,  and  their  garments \ntherein will be silk. \n\n24.  They  have  been  guided  to  the  good \nwords;  they  have  been  guided  in  the \npath of the Most Praised. \n\n25.

The  (livestock)  provide  you  with \nmany benefits for a period, before \nbeing donated to the ancient shrine. \n34.  For  each  congregation  we  have \ndecreed  rites  whereby  they  com-\nmemorate the name of GOD  for \nproviding them with the livestock. \nYour god is one and the same god; \nyou shall all submit to Him. Give \ngood news to the obedient. \n\n35.  They  are  the  ones  whose  hearts \ntremble  upon  mentioning  GOD, \nthey  steadfastly  persevere  during \nadversity, they observe the Contact \nPrayers (Salat), and from our pro-\nvisions to them, they give to charity. \n36.  The animal offerings are among the \nrites decreed by GOD for your own \ngood.* You shall mention GOD\u2019s \nname on them while they are stand-\ning in line. Once they are offered for \nsacrifice, you shall eat therefrom \nand feed the poor and the needy. \nThis is why we subdued them for \nyou, that you may show your ap-\npreciation. \n\n37.  Neither their meat, nor their blood \nreaches GOD. What reaches Him is \nyour righteousness. He has subdued \nthem for you, that you may show \nyour  appreciation  by  glorifying \nGOD for guiding you. Give good \nnews to the charitable. \n\n*22:26-27 Abraham was the original messenger of Submission (Islam). See 22:78 and \nAppendix 9. \n*22:36 Animal offerings from the pilgrims conserve the resources at the pilgrimage site. \nNote that almost 2,000,000 pilgrims converge on Mecca during pilgrimage. \n1650 \n\n 94276 \n\n \n\f"

It  is  a  fact  that  GOD  is  the  Truth, \nwhile  the  setting  up  of  any  idols  be-\nside  Him  constitutes  a  falsehood, \nand  that  GOD  is  the  Most  High,  the \nSupreme. \n\n63.

The  glass  container  is \nlike  a  bright,  pearl-like  star.  The  fuel \nthereof  is  supplied  from  a  blessed \noil-producing  tree,  that  is  neither \neastern,  nor  western.  Its  oil  is  almost \nself-radiating;  needs  no  fire  to  ignite \nit.  Light  upon  light.  GOD  guides  to \nHis light whoever wills (to be guid-\ned).  GOD  thus  cites  the  parables  for \nthe people. GOD is fully aware of all \nthings. \n\n36.

People  who  are  not  distracted  by \nbusiness  or  trade  from  commem-\norating  GOD;  they  observe  the  Con-\ntact  Prayers  (Salat),  and  give  the \nobligatory charity (Zakat), and they \n\nare  conscious  of  the  day  when  the \nminds and the eyes will be horrified. \n\n38.  GOD  will  certainly  reward  them  for \ntheir  good  works,  and  will  shower \nthem  with  His  grace.  GOD  provides \nfor  whomever  He  wills  without  lim-\nits. \n\nChasing A Mirage \n\n39.  As  for  those  who  disbelieve,  their \nworks  are  like  a  mirage  in  the  desert. \nA  thirsty  person  thinks  that  it  is \nwater.  But  when  he  reaches  it,  he \nfinds  that  it  is  nothing,  and  he  finds \nGOD  there  instead,  to  requite  him \nfully for his works. GOD is the most \nefficient reckoner. \n\nExile  From  God: \nTotal Darkness \n\n40.  Another  allegory  is  that  of  being  in \ntotal  darkness  in  the  midst  of  a \nviolent  ocean,  with  waves  upon \nwaves,  in  addition  to  thick  fog. \nDarkness  upon  darkness\u2014if  he \nlooked  at  his  own  hand,  he  could \nbarely  see  it.

Each  knows  its  prayer  and \nits  glorification.  GOD  is  fully  aware \nof everything they do. \n\n42.  To  GOD  belongs  the  sovereignty  of \nthe  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  to \nGOD is the final destiny. \n\n43.

O you who believe, permission must \nbe requested by your servants and \nthe children who have not attained \npuberty  (before  entering  your \nrooms). This is to be done in three \ninstances\u2014before \nthe  Dawn \nPrayer, at noon when you change \nyour clothes to rest, and after the \nNight Prayer. These are three pri-\nvate times for you. At other times, it \nis not wrong for you or them to min-\ngle with one another. GOD thus \nclarifies  the  revelations  for  you. \nGOD is Omniscient, Most Wise. \n59.  Once  the  children  reach  puberty, \nthey must ask permission (before \nentering) like those who became \nadults before them have asked per-\nmission (before entering). GOD thus \nclarifies  His  revelations  for  you. \nGOD is Omniscient, Most Wise. \n\nYou Shall Dress Modestly \n\n60.  The elderly women who do not ex-\npect to get married commit nothing \nwrong by relaxing their dress code, \nprovided  they  do  not  reveal  too \nmuch of their bodies. To maintain \nmodesty is better for them. GOD is \nHearer, Knower. \n\nBe Sure Your Meal is Lawful \n\n61.  The blind is not to be blamed, the \ncrippled is not to be blamed, nor the \nhandicapped is to be blamed, just as \nyou are not to be blamed for eating \nat your homes, or the homes of your \nfathers, or the homes of your moth-\ners, or the homes of your brothers, \nor the homes of your sisters, or the \nhomes of your fathers\u2019 brothers, or \n\nthe homes of your fathers\u2019 sisters, or \nthe homes of your mothers\u2019 broth-\ners, or the homes of your mothers\u2019 \nsisters, or the homes that belong to \nyou and you possess their keys, or \nthe homes of your friends. You com-\nmit  nothing  wrong  by  eating  to-\ngether or as individuals. When you \nenter any home, you shall greet each \nother a greeting from GOD that is \nblessed  and  good.  GOD  thus  ex-\nplains the revelations for you, that \nyou may understand. \n\n62.  The  true  believers  are  those  who \nbelieve in GOD and His messen-\nger,* and when they are with him in \na community meeting, they do not \nleave  him  without  permission. \nThose who ask permission are the \nones who do believe in GOD and \nHis messenger. If they ask your per-\nmission, in order to tend to some of \ntheir affairs, you may grant permis-\nsion to whomever you wish, and ask \nGOD to forgive them. GOD is For- \ngiver, Most Merciful. \n\n63.  Do not treat the messenger\u2019s re-\nquests as you treat each others\u2019 re-\nquests. GOD is fully aware of those \namong you who sneak away using \nflimsy  excuses.  Let  them  beware\u2014 \nthose  who  disobey  his  orders\u2014for  a \ndisaster may strike them, or a severe \nretribution. \n\n64.  Absolutely, to GOD belongs every-\nthing in the heavens and the earth. \nHe fully knows every condition you \nmay be in. The day you are returned \nto Him, He will inform them of \neverything they had done. GOD is \nfully aware of all things. \n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\n*24:62 This verse refers to God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant; by adding the gematrical \nvalue of \u201cRashad\u201d (505) plus the value of \u201cKhalifa\u201d (725), plus the verse number (62), \nwe get 1292, a multiple of 19 (1292 = 19x68).

Most  blessed  is  the  One  who  reveal- \ned  the  Statute  Book  to  His  servant, \nso  he  can  serve  as  a  warner  to  the \nwhole world. \n\n2.  The  One  to  whom  belongs  all  sov-\nereignty  of  the  heavens  and  the \nearth.  He  never  had  a  son,  nor  does \nHe  have  any  partners  in  sovereignty. \nHe  created  everything  in  exact \nmeasure;  He  precisely  designed  ev-\nerything.* \n\n3.  Yet,  they  set  up  beside  Him  gods \nwho  do  not  create  anything\u2014they \nthemselves  are  created\u2014and  who \npossess  no  power  to  even  harm  or \nbenefit  themselves,  nor  do  they  pos-\nsess  any  power  to  control  life,  or \ndeath, or resurrection. \n\nThe Disbelievers Rebutted by the \nQuran\u2019s Mathematical Code \n4.  Those  who  disbelieved  said,  \u201cThis \nis  a  fabrication  that  he  produced, \nwith  the  help  of  some  other  people.\u201d \nThey  have  uttered  a  blasphemy  and \na falsehood. \n\n5.  They  also  said,  \u201cTales  from  the  past \nthat  he  wrote  down;  they  were  dic-\ntated to him day and night.\u201d* \n\n6.  Say,  \u201cThis  was  revealed  by  the  One \nwho  knows  the  Secret*  in  the  heav-\nens  and  the  earth.  He  is  Forgiving, \nMost Merciful.\u201d \n\nTypical Utterances of Disbelievers \n7.  And  they  said,  \u201cHow  come  this \nmessenger  eats  the  food  and  walks \nin  the  markets?  If  only  an  angel \ncould  come  down  with  him,  to  serve \nwith him as a preacher!\u201d \n\n8.  Or,  \u201cIf  only  a  treasure  could  be  gi- \nven  to  him!\u201d  Or,  \u201cIf  only  he  could \npossess  an  orchard  from  which  he \neats!\u201d  The  transgressors  also  said, \n\u201cYou  are  following  a  bewitched \nman.\u201d \n\n9.  Note  how  they  called  you  all  kinds \nof  names,  and  how  this  led  them \nastray, never to find their way back. \n\n10.  Most blessed is the One who can, if \nHe  wills,  give  you  much  better  than \ntheir  demands\u2014gardens  with  flow-\ning streams, and many mansions. \n\nThe Real Reason \n\n11.  In  fact,  they  have  disbelieved  in  the \nHour  (Day  of  Resurrection),  and  we \nhave  prepared  for  those  who  dis-\nbelieve in the Hour a flaming Hell. \n\n*25:2 When we launch astronauts into space, we measure precisely the amount of food, \nwater, oxygen, and other needs throughout the journey. Similarly, God has launched us  \ninto  space\u2014on  board  spaceship  Earth\u2014and  He  has  designed  all  kinds  of  renewable \nprovisions  for  us  and  other  creatures,  a  perfect  design.  Think,  for  example,  of  the \nsymbiotic relationship between us and the plants; we use the oxygen they produce in \nphotosynthesis, while they use the carbon dioxide we produce in respiration. \n*25:5 Muhammad\u2019s contemporaries knew that he was a literate man who could read \nand write; he wrote God\u2019s revelations with his own hand (see Appendix 28). \n*25:6  The  Quran\u2019s  miraculous  mathematical  code,  the  incontrovertible  answer  to  the \ndisbelievers\u2019 claims, remained a divinely guarded secret for 1400 years. God\u2019s Messenger \nof the Covenant was destined to unveil it by God\u2019s leave (Appendices 1, 2, & 26). \n1787 \n\n98342 \n\n \n \n\f"

And  when  they  are  thrown  into  it, \nthrough  a  narrow  place,  all  shack- \nled, they will declare their remorse. \n14.  You  will  not  declare  just  a  single \nremorse,  on  that  day;  you  will  suffer \nthrough  a  great  number  of  remor- \nses. \n\nReward for the Righteous \n15.  Say,  \u201cIs  this  better  or  the  eternal \nParadise  that  is  promised  for  the \nrighteous?  It  is  their  well  deserved \nreward; a well deserved destiny.\u201d \n16.  They  get  anything  they  wish  therein, \nforever.  This  is  your  Lord\u2019s  irrev-\nocable promise. \n\n17.  On  the  day  when  He  summons \nthem,  together  with  the  idols  they \nhad set up beside GOD, He will say, \n\u201cHave  you  misled  these  servants  of \nMine,  or  did  they  go  astray  on  their \nown?\u201d \n\n18.  They  will  say,  \u201cBe  You  glorified,  it \nwas  not  right  for  us  to  set  up  any \nlords  beside  You.  But  You  allowed \nthem  to  enjoy,  together  with  their \nparents.  Consequently,  they  dis-\nregarded  the  message  and  thus  be-\ncame wicked people.\u201d \n\nthem  from  the  retribution  they  have \nincurred,  nor  can  you  help  them  in \nany  way.  Anyone  among  you  who \ncommits evil, we will commit him to \nsevere retribution. \n\nMessengers Are Just Human Beings \n20.  We  did  not  send  any  messengers \nbefore  you  who  did  not  eat  food  and \nwalk  in  the  markets.  We  thus  test \nyou  by  each  other;  will  you  stead-\nfastly persevere? Your Lord is Seer. \n21.  Those  who  do  not  expect  to  meet  us \nsaid,  \u201cIf  only  the  angels  could  come \ndown  to  us,  or  we  could  see  our \nLord  (we  would  then  believe)!\u201d  In-\ndeed,  they  have  committed  a  gross \narrogance,  and  have  produced  a \ngross blasphemy. \n\n22.  The  day  they  see  the  angels,  it  will \nnot  be  good  news  for  the  guilty;  they \nwill  say,  \u201cNow,  we  are  irreversibly \nconfined.\u201d \n\n23.  We  will  look  at  all  the  works  they \nhave  done,  and  render  them  null \nand void. \n\n24.  The  dwellers  of  Paradise  are  far \nbetter  on  that  day;  they  will  hear \nbetter news. \n\n25.  The  heaven  will  break  apart,  into \nmasses  of  clouds,  and  the  angels  will \ndescend in multitudes. \n\n19.  They  have  disbelieved  in  the  mes-\nsage  you  have  given  them,  and,  con-\nsequently, you can neither protect \n\n26.  All  sovereignty  on  that  day  belongs \nto  the  Most  Gracious.  For  the  dis-\nbelievers, it will be a difficult day. \n\n  1788 \n\n 98359 \n\n \n\f"

The  day  will  come  when  the  trans-\ngressor  will  bite  his  hands  (in  an-\nguish)  and  say,  \u201cAlas,  I  wish  I  had \nfollowed  the  path  with  the  mes-\nsenger. \n\n28. \u201cAlas,  woe  to  me,  I  wish  I  did  not \n\ntake that person as a friend. \n\n29. \u201cHe  has  led  me  away  from  the  mes-\nsage  after  it  came  to  me.  Indeed,  the \ndevil lets down his human victims.\u201d \n30. The  messenger*  said,  \u201cMy  Lord, \nmy people have deserted this Qu- \nran.\u201d \n\n31.  We  also  set  up  against  every  proph-   \net  enemies  from  among  the  guilty. \nYour  Lord  suffices  as  a  guide,  a \nmaster. \n\n32.  Those  who  disbelieved  said,  \u201cWhy \ndid  not  the  Quran  come  through \nhim  all  at  once?\u201d  We  have  released \nit  to  you  gradually,  in  order  to  fix  it \nin  your  memory.

Whatever  argument  they  come  up \nwith,  we  provide  you  with  the  truth, \nand a better understanding. \n\n34.  Those  who  are  forcibly  summoned \nto  Hell  are  in  the  worst  position; \nthey  are  the  farthest  from  the  right \npath. \n\n35.  We  have  given  Moses  the  scripture, \nand  appointed  his  brother  Aaron  to \nbe his assistant. \n\n36.  We  said,  \u201cGo,  both  of  you,  to  the \npeople  who  rejected  our  revela-\ntions,\u201d  and  subsequently,  we  utterly \nannihilated the rejectors. \n\n37.  Similarly,  when  the  people  of  Noah \ndisbelieved  the  messengers,  we \ndrowned  them,  and  we  set  them  up \nas  a  sign  for  the  people.  We  have \nprepared  for  the  transgressors  a \npainful retribution. \n\n38.  Also  \u2018\u00c3d,  Thamoud,  the  inhabitants \nof  Al-Russ,  and  many  generations \nbetween them. \n\n39.  To  each  of  these  groups,  we  deliver-  \ned  sufficient  examples,  before  we \nannihilated them. \n\n40.  They  have  passed  by  the  community \nthat  was  showered  with  a  miserable \nshower  (Sodom).  Did  they  not  see \nit?  The  fact  is,  they  never  believed  in \nresurrection. \n\nMessengers Ridiculed \n\n41.  When  they  saw  you,  they  always \nridiculed  you:  \u201cIs  this  the  one  cho- \nsen by GOD to be a messenger? \n42.  \u201cHe  almost  diverted  us  from  our \ngods,  if  it  were  not  that  we  steadfast-   \nly  persevered  with  them.\u201d  They  will \ncertainly  find  out,  when  they  see  the \nretribution,  who  are  the  real  stray- \ners from the path. \n\nThe Ego as a god \n\n43.  Have you seen the one whose god is \nhis own ego? Will you be his advo-\ncate? \n\n*25:27-30 This verse refers also to God\u2019s Messenger of the Covenant whose name is \nmathematically  coded  in  the  Quran  as  \u201cRashad  Khalifa.\u201d  If  you  write  down  the \ngematrical value of \u201cRashad\u201d (505), followed by the gematrical value of \u201cKhalifa\u201d \n(725), followed by this sura number (25), followed by verses 27, 28, 29, and 30, the final \nnumber (5057252527282930) is a multiple of 19 (see Appendices 2 & 26 for details). \nThe prophet Muhammad will also make such a statement as in 25:30 on the Day of \nJudgment. \n1789 \n\n98400 \n\n \n \n\f"

They  pretend  to  listen,  but  most  of \n\nthem are liars. \n\n224.  As  for  the  poets,  they  are  followed \n\nonly by the strayers. \n\n225.

Recall that Moses said to his family, \n\u201cI see a fire; let me bring you news \ntherefrom, or a torch to warm you.\u201d \n8.  When he came to it, he was called: \n\u201cBlessed is the One (who is speaking \nfrom)  within the  fire, and those \naround it.\u201d Glory be to GOD, Lord \nof the universe. \n\n9.  \u201cO Moses, this is Me, GOD, the \n\nAlmighty, Most Wise. \n\n10.  \u201cThrow down your staff.\u201d When he \nsaw it moving like a demon, he \nturned around and fled. \u201cO Moses, \ndo not be afraid. My messengers \nshall not fear. \n\n11.  \u201cExcept those who commit a trans-\ngression, then substitute righteous-\nness after sinning; I am Forgiving, \nMost Merciful. \n\n12.  \u201cPut your hand in your pocket; it \nwill come out white, without a \nblemish. These are among nine mir-\nacles to Pharaoh and his people, for \nthey are wicked people.\u201d \n\n13.  When our miracles were presented \nto them, clear and profound, they \nsaid, \u201cThis is obviously magic.\u201d \n14.  They rejected them and were utter-\nly convinced of their wrong ways, \ndue to their arrogance. Note the \nconsequences for the evildoers. \n\nDavid and Solomon \n\n15.  We endowed  David and  Solomon \nwith knowledge, and they said,  \n\n    The Ant (Al-Naml) 27:6-22 \n\n\u201cPraise GOD for blessing us more \nthan  many  of  His  believing  ser-\nvants.\u201d \n\n16.  Solomon was David\u2019s heir. He said, \n\u201cO people, we have been endowed \nwith understanding the language of \nthe birds, and all kinds of things \nhave been bestowed upon us. This is \nindeed a real blessing.\u201d \n\n17.  Mobilized in the service of Solomon \nwere his obedient soldiers of jinns \nand humans, as well as the birds; all \nat his disposal. \n\n18.  When they approached the valley of \nthe ants, one ant said, \u201cO you ants, \ngo into your homes, lest you get \ncrushed by Solomon and his sol-\ndiers, without perceiving.\u201d* \n\n19.  He smiled and laughed at her state-\nment,* and said, \u201cMy Lord, direct \nme to be appreciative of the bless-\nings You have bestowed upon me \nand  my  parents,  and  to  do  the \nrighteous works that please You. \nAdmit me by Your mercy into the \ncompany  of  Your  righteous  ser-\nvants.\u201d \n\n20.  He inspected the birds, and noted: \n\u201cWhy do I not see the hoopoe? Why \nis he missing? \n\n21.  \u201cI  will  punish  him  severely  or \nsacrifice him, unless he gives me a \ngood excuse.\u201d \n\n22.  He did not wait for long.

This  helps  assure  us  that  such  strange  phenomena  are \nindicative of God\u2019s power. This sura\u2019s initials, T.S., constitute a complex part of the \nmathematical miracles related to the Quranic initials.

Pharaoh  turned  into  a  tyrant  on \nearth,  and  discriminated  against \nsome  people.  He  persecuted  a  help-\nless  group  of  them,  slaughtering \ntheir  sons,  while  sparing  their \ndaughters. He was indeed wicked. \n\nGod Compensates the Oppressed \n5.  We  willed  to  compensate  those  who \nwere  oppressed  on  earth,  and  to \nturn  them  into  leaders,  and  make \nthem the inheritors. \n\n6.

Pharaoh\u2019s  wife  said,  \u201cThis  can  be  a \njoyous  find  for  me  and  you.  Do  not \nkill  him,  for  he  may  be  of  some \nbenefit  for  us,  or  we  may  adopt  him \nto be our son.\u201d They had no idea. \n\n10.

Therefore, you shall seek pro-\nvisions only from GOD. You shall \nworship Him alone, and be appre-\nciative  of  Him;  to  Him  is  your  ul-\ntimate return. \n\n18.  If  you  disbelieve,  generations  be-\nfore you have also disbelieved. The \nsole function of the messenger is to \ndeliver (the message). \n\nStudy the Origin of Life* \n\n19.  Have they not seen how GOD in-\nitiates the creation, then repeats it? \nThis is easy for GOD to do. \n\n20.  Say, \u201cRoam the earth and find out \nthe origin of life.\u201d* For GOD will \nthus  initiate  the  creation  in  the \nHereafter. GOD is Omnipotent. \n21.  He condemns to retribution whom-\never He wills, and showers His mer-\ncy upon whomever He wills. Ul-\ntimately, to Him you will be turned \nover. \n\n22.  None of you can escape from these \nfacts, on earth or in the heaven, and \nyou have none beside GOD as a \nLord and Master. \n\n23.  Those  who  disbelieve  in  GOD\u2019s \nrevelations,  and  in  meeting  Him, \nhave  despaired  from  My  mercy. \nThey have incurred a painful retri-\nbution. \n\nBack to Abraham \n\n24.  The only response from his people \nwas their saying, \u201cKill him, or burn \nhim.\u201d But GOD saved him from the \nfire. This should provide lessons for \npeople who believe. \n\nSocial Pressure: A Profound Disaster \n25.  He said, \u201cYou worship beside GOD \npowerless idols due to peer pres-\nsure, just to preserve some friend-\nship among you in this worldly life. \nBut then, on the Day of Resurrec-\ntion, you will disown one another, \nand curse one another. Your destiny \nis Hell, wherein you cannot help one \nanother.\u201d \n\n26.  Lot believed with him and said, \u201cI \nam emigrating to my Lord. He is the \nAlmighty, the Most Wise.\u201d \n\n27.  We granted him Isaac and Jacob, \nwe  assigned  to  his  descendants \nprophethood and the scriptures, we \nendowed him with his due recom-\npense in this life, and in the Here-\nafter  he  will  surely be with  the \nrighteous. \n\nLot \n\n28.  Lot said to his people, \u201cYou commit \nsuch an abomination, no one in the \nworld has ever done it before you. \n29.  \u201cYou practice sex with the men, you \ncommit highway robbery, and you \nallow  all  kinds  of  vice  in  your \nsociety.\u201d The only response from his \npeople was to say, \u201cBring to us \nGOD\u2019s retribution, if you are truth-\nful.\u201d \n\n*29:19-20 We learn from the Quran that evolution is a divinely guided process.

When  our  messengers  went  to \nAbraham  with  good  news  (about \nIsaac\u2019s birth), they also said, \u201cWe \nare on our way to annihilate the \npeople of that town (Sodom).

They  disbelieved  him  and,  conse-\nquently, the earthquake annihilated \nthem; they were left dead in their \nhomes by morning. \n\n38.  Similarly, \u2018\u00c3d and Thamoud (were \nannihilated).

Consequently, \nthey could not evade (the retribu-\ntion). \n\n40.  All those disbelievers were doomed \nas a consequence of their sins. Some \nof them we annihilated by violent \nwinds, some were annihilated by the \nquake, some we caused the earth to \nswallow,  and  some  we  drowned. \nGOD is not the One who wronged \nthem; it is they who wronged their \nown souls. \n\nThe Spider \n\n41.

This  provides  a \nsufficient proof for the believers. \n\n*29:41-43 It takes a knowledgeable person to know that the Black Widow spider kills \nher mate. The use of the feminine reference to the spider in 29:41 is thus significant. This \nis in addition to the fact that the spider web is physically very flimsy. \n\n1889 \n\n103473 \n\n \n\f"

Seeing how the Muslims en masse have idolized \nMuhammad, it is obvious that if the Quran\u2019s mathematical miracle were also revealed \nthrough Muhammad, many people would have worshiped him as God incarnate.

He will \njust as certainly resurrect the dead. \nHe is Omnipotent. \n\n51.  Had we sent upon them instead a \nyellow sandstorm, they would have \ncontinued to disbelieve. \n\n52.  You cannot make the dead, nor the \ndeaf, hear the call, once they turn \naway. \n\n53.  Nor can you guide the blind out of \ntheir  straying.  You  can  only  be \nheard by those who believe in our \nrevelations, and decide to become \nsubmitters. \n\nThis Life is Very Short \n\n54.  GOD is the One who created you \nweak, then granted  you  after  the \nweakness  strength,  then  substituted \nafter the strength weakness and gray \nhair. He creates whatever He wills. \nHe is the Omniscient, the Omnip-\notent. \n\n55.  On the day when the Hour comes to \npass, the guilty will swear that they \nlasted (in this world) only one hour. \nThat is how wrong they were. \n56.  Those who are blessed with knowl-\nedge and faith will say, \u201cYou have \nlasted, according to GOD\u2019s decree, \nuntil the Day of Resurrection. Now, \nthis is the Day of Resurrection, but \nyou failed to recognize it.\u201d \n\n57.  Therefore, no apology, on that day, \nwill  benefit  the  transgressors,  nor \nwill they be excused. \n\n58.  Thus, we have cited for the people \nin this Quran all kinds of examples. \nYet, no matter what kind of proof \n\nyou present to the disbelievers, they \nsay, \u201cYou are falsifiers.\u201d \n\nDivine Intervention \n\n59.  GOD thus seals the hearts of those \n\nwho do not know. \n\n60. Therefore,  you  shall  steadfastly \npersevere\u2014for  GOD\u2019s  promise  is \nthe  truth\u2014and  do  not  be  intimi-\ndated by those who have not attain-\ned certainty. \n\n                                \u2666 \u2666 \u2666 \u2666  \n\nSura 31: Luqm\u00e3n \n(Luqm\u00e3n) \nIn the name of God,     \n\nMost Gracious, Most Merciful \n\n1.

They  are  following  the  guidance \nfrom their Lord, and they are the \nwinners. \n\n6.  Among the people, there are those \nwho uphold baseless Hadith, and \nthus divert others from the path of \nGOD without knowledge, and take \nit in vain.

He  created  the  heavens  without  pil-     \nlars  that  you  can  see.  He  established \non  earth  stabilizers  (mountains)  lest   \nit  tumbles  with  you,  and  He  spread \non  it  all  kinds  of  creatures.

As \nfor  those  who  turn  unappreciative, \nGOD is in no need, Praiseworthy. \n13.  Recall  that  Luqm\u00e3n  said  to  his  son,   \nas  he  enlightened  him,  \u201cO  my  son, \ndo not set up any idols beside GOD; \nidolatry is a gross injustice.\u201d* \n\nThe Second Commandment \n14.  We  enjoined  the  human  being  to \nhonor  his  parents.  His  mother  bore \nhim,  and  the  load  got  heavier  and \nheavier.  It  takes  two  years  (of  inten-     \nsive  care)  until  weaning.  You  shall \nbe  appreciative  of  Me,  and  of  your \nparents.  To  Me  is  the  ultimate  des-\ntiny. \n\n15. If  they  try  to  force  you  to  set  up any \nidols beside Me, do not obey them. \n\nLuqm\u00e3n\u2019s Advice \n\n16.  \u201cO  my  son,  know  that  even  some-\nthing  as  tiny  as  a  mustard  seed,  deep \ninside  a  rock,  be it  in the heavens or \nthe earth, GOD will bring it. GOD is \nSublime, Cognizant. \n\n17.  \u201cO  my  son,  you  shall  observe  the \nContact  Prayers  (Salat).  You  shall \nadvocate  righteousness  and  forbid \nevil,  and  remain  steadfast  in  the  face  \nof  adversity.  These  are  the  most \nhonorable traits. \n\n18.  \u201cYou  shall  not  treat  the  people  with \narrogance,  nor  shall  you  roam  the \nearth  proudly.  GOD  does  not  like \nthe arrogant showoffs. \n\n19. \u201cWalk  humbly  and  lower  your \nvoice\u2014the  ugliest  voice  is  the  don- \nkey's voice.\u201d \n\n20.  Do you not see that GOD has com- \nmitted  in  your  service  everything  in \nthe  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  has \nshowered  you  with  His  blessings\u2014 \nobvious  and  hidden?  Yet,  some \npeople  argue  about  GOD  without \nknowledge,  without  guidance,  and \nwithout the enlightening scripture. \n\nFollowing the Parents Blindly:      \nA Common Tragedy \n\n21.

Those  who  submit  completely  to \nGOD, while leading a righteous life, \nhave  gotten  hold  of  the  strongest \nbond. For GOD is in full control of \nall things. \n\n23.  As for those who disbelieve, do not \nbe saddened by their disbelief. To us \nis their ultimate return, then we will \ninform them of everything they had \ndone. GOD is fully aware of the in-\nnermost thoughts. \n\n24.  We let them enjoy temporarily, then \ncommit them to severe retribution. \n\nThey Believe in God \n\n25.

To GOD belongs everything in the \nheavens and the earth. GOD is the \nMost Rich, Most Praiseworthy. \n\nThese Are All the Words We Need \n\n27.  If all the trees on earth were made \ninto  pens,  and  the  ocean  supplied \nthe ink, augmented by  seven  more \noceans,  the  words  of  GOD  would \nnot run out.

This proves that GOD is the truth, \nwhile  any  idol  they  set  up  beside \nHim is falsehood, and that GOD is \nthe Most High, Most Great. \n\n31.  Do you not see that the ships roam \nthe sea, carrying GOD\u2019s provisions, \nto  show  you  some  of  His  proofs? \nIndeed,  these  should  be  sufficient \nproofs  for  everyone  who  is  stead-\nfast, appreciative. \n\n32.  When violent waves surround them, \nthey implore GOD, sincerely devot-\ning their prayers to Him alone. But \nas  soon  as  He  saves  them  to  the \nshore,  some  of  them  revert.  None \ndiscards  our  revelations  except \nthose  who  are  betrayers,  unap-\npreciative. \n\n33.  O people, you shall reverence your \nLord, and fear a day when a father \ncannot  help  his  own  child,  nor  a \nchild can help his father. Certainly, \nGOD's promise is truth. Therefore, \ndo not be distracted by this life; do \nnot  be  distracted  from  GOD  by \nmere illusions. \n\nThings We May and May Not Know* \n34.  With GOD is the knowledge regard- \ning  the  Hour  (end  of  the  world).*  He \nis the One who sends down the rain, \nand  He  knows  the  contents  of  the \nwomb. No soul knows what will hap- \npen  to  it  tomorrow,  and  no  one \nknows in which land he or she will \ndie. GOD is Omniscient, Cognizant. \n\n*31:34 God reveals His knowledge whenever He wills. We learn from this verse that we \nmay be able to predict the rain, and the gender of the fetus. But we can never know the \ntime or place of death. In accordance with 72:27, God has revealed the end of the world \nthrough  His  Messenger  of  the  Covenant.

When  the  true  believers  saw  the \nparties (ready to attack), they said, \n\u201cThis is what GOD and His mes- \nsenger have promised us, and GOD \nand  His  messenger  are  truthful.\u201d \nThis  (dangerous  situation)  only \nstrengthened  their  faith  and  aug- \nmented their submission. \n\n23.  Among  the  believers  there  are \npeople who fulfill their pledges with \nGOD. Some of them died, while \nothers stand ready, never wavering. \n\n24.  GOD will surely recompense the \ntruthful for their truthfulness, and \nwill punish the hypocrites, if He so \nwills, or redeem them. GOD is For- \ngiver, Most Merciful. \n\nDuring Muhammad\u2019s Time \n\n25.  GOD  repulsed  those  who  disbe- \nlieved with their rage, and they left \nempty-handed. GOD thus spared \nthe believers any fighting. GOD is \nPowerful, Almighty. \n\n*33:21 Satan took this verse out of context, and relied on the people\u2019s idolization of the \nprophet  Muhammad  to  innovate  a  whole  set  of  unauthorized  and  unreasonable \nregulations called \u201cSunna of the Prophet.\u201d This created a totally different religion (see \n42:21 and Appendix 18). \n\n1993 \n\n  105494 \n\n \n\f"

Therefore, \nyou  shall  not  speak  too  softly,  lest \nthose  with  disease  in  their  hearts \nmay  get  the  wrong  ideas;  you  shall \nspeak only righteousness. \n\nThe Parties (Al-Ahz\u00e3b) 33:26-36 \n\n33.

You \nshall  observe  the  Contact  Prayers \n(Salat),  and  give  the  obligatory \ncharity  (Zakat),  and  obey  GOD  and \nHis  messenger.  GOD  wishes  to  re- \nmove  all  unholiness  from  you,  O  you \nwho  live  around  the  Sacred  Shrine, \nand to purify you completely. \n\n34.

He  is \nMost  Merciful  towards  the  believ- \ners. \n\n44.

Do  not  obey  the  disbelievers  and \nthe  hypocrites,  disregard  their  in- \nsults,  and  put  your  trust  in  GOD; \nGOD suffices as an advocate. \n\nMarriage Laws \n\n49.  O  you  who  believe,  if  you  married \nbelieving  women,  then  divorced \nthem  before  having  intercourse  with \nthem,  they  do  not  owe  you  any  wait- \ning  interim  (before  marrying  another \nman).

This is a tragic human trait as we see in 40:34. \nThose who readily believe God realize that God sends His purifying and consolidating \nMessenger of the Covenant after the final prophet Muhammad (3:81, 33:7). \n*33:41-42  Your  god  is  whatever  occupies  your  thoughts  most  of  the  time.

However,  her \nforfeiting  of  the  dowry  applies  only \nto  the  prophet,  and  not  to  the  other \nbelievers.  We  have  already  decreed \ntheir  rights  in  regard  to  their \nspouses  or  what  they  already  have. \nThis  is  to  spare  you  any  embarrass- \nment.

You \nmust  be  content  with  those  already \nmade  lawful  to  you.  GOD  is  watch-   \nful over all things. \n\nEtiquette \n\n53.  O  you  who  believe,  do  not  enter  the \nprophet\u2019s  homes  unless  you  are \ngiven  permission  to  eat,  nor  shall \nyou  force  such  an  invitation  in  any \nmanner.  If  you  are  invited,  you  may \nenter.  When  you  finish  eating,  you \nshall  leave;  do  not  engage  him  in \nlengthy  conversations.  This  used  to \nhurt  the  prophet,  and  he  was  too  shy \nto  tell  you.  But GOD  does  not  shy \naway  from  the  truth.  If  you  have  to \nask  his  wives  for  something,  ask \nthem  from  behind  a  barrier.  This  is \npurer  for  your  hearts  and  their \nhearts.  You  are  not  to  hurt  the  mes- \nsenger of GOD. You shall not  marry \nhis  wives  after  him,  for  this  would  be \na gross offense in the sight of GOD.* \n54.  Whether  you  declare  anything,  or \nhide  it,  GOD  is  fully  aware  of  all \nthings. \n\n55.  The  women  may  relax  (their  dress \ncode)  around  their  fathers,  their \nsons,  their  brothers,  the  sons  of  their \nbrothers,  the  sons  of  their  sisters, \nthe  other  women,  and  their  (female) \nservants.  They  shall  reverence \nGOD. GOD witnesses all things. \n\n*33:53 We are enjoined in 4:22 from marrying women who were previously married to \nour  fathers.  Nor  can  the  father  marry  the  divorced wife  of  his  son  (4:23).  This  divine \ncommandment  preserves  our  respect  for  our  fathers  and  their  most  private  affairs. \nSimilarly, the prophet was a father figure to the believers of his time. For the good of \nthose believers, God enjoined them from marrying women who were previously married to \nthe  prophet.  Marriage  is  a  sacred  and  very  private  relationship,  and  the  prophet\u2019s  \nprivate life was better kept private. \n2035 \n\n  106400 \n\n \n\f"

This is not too difficult for GOD. \n18.  No soul can carry the sins of another \nsoul.

Cite  for  them  the  example  of  people \nin  a  community  that  received  the \nmessengers. \n\n Y. S. (Y\u00e3 S\u00een) 36:3-24 \n14.  When  we  sent  to  them  two  (mes- \nsengers),  they  disbelieved  them.  We \nthen  supported  them  by  a  third. \nThey  said,  \u201cWe  are  (God\u2019s)  mes- \nsengers to you.\u201d \n\n15.  They  said,  \u201cYou  are  no  more  than \nhuman  beings  like  us.  The  Most \nGracious  did  not  send  down  any- \nthing. You are liars.\u201d \n\n16.  They  said,  \u201cOur  Lord  knows  that  we \n\nhave been sent to you. \n\n17.  \u201cOur  sole  mission  is  to  deliver  the \n\nmessage.\u201d \n\n18.  They  said,  \u201cWe  consider  you  bad \nomens.  Unless  you  refrain,  we  will \nsurely  stone  you,  or  afflict  you  with \npainful retribution.\u201d \n\n19.  They  said,  \u201cYour  omen  depends  on \nyour  response,  now  that  you  have \nbeen  reminded.  Indeed,  you  are \ntransgressing people.\u201d \n\n20.  A  man  came  from  the  other  end  of \nthe  city,  saying,  \u201cO  my  people,  fol- \nlow the messengers. \n\n21.  \u201cFollow  those  who  do  not  ask  you \n\nfor any wage, and are guided. \n\n22. \u201cWhy  should  I  not  worship  the  One \nwho  initiated  me,  and  to  Him  is  your \nultimate return? \n\n23.  \u201cShall  I  set  up  beside  Him  gods?  If \nthe  Most  Gracious  willed  any  harm \nfor  me,  their  intercession  cannot \nhelp  me  one  bit,  nor  can  they  rescue \nme. \n\n24. \u201cIn  that  case,  I  would  be  totally \n\nastray. \n\n*36:3 See Appendices 2 & 26 for the irrefutable physical evidence. \n\n*36:10 Everyone is already stamped as a believer or a disbeliever.

(At  the  time  of  his  death)  he  was \ntold,  \u201cEnter  Paradise.\u201d  He  said, \n\u201cOh, I wish my people knew. \n\n27.  \u201cThat  my  Lord  has  forgiven  me,  and \n\nmade me honorable.\u201d \n\n28.  We  did  not  send  down  upon  his \npeople,  after  him,  soldiers  from  the \nsky;  we  did  not  need  to  send  them \ndown. \n\n29.  All  it  took  was  one  blow,  where- \n\nupon they were stilled. \n\nRidiculing The Messengers:         \n\nA Tragic Human Trait* \n\n30.  How  sorry  is  the  people\u2019s  condition! \nEvery  time  a  messenger  went  to \nthem, they always ridiculed him. \n31.  Did  they  not  see  how  many  genera- \ntions  we  annihilated  before  them, \nand how they never return to them? \n32.  Every  one  of  them  will  be  sum- \n\nmoned before us. \n\nSigns of God \n\n33.  One  sign  for  them  is  the  dead  land: \nwe  revive  it  and  produce  from  it \ngrains for their food. \n\n34.  We  grow  in  it  gardens  of  date  palms, \nand  grapes,  and  we  cause  springs  to \ngush out therein. \n\n35. This  is  to  provide  them  with  fruits, \nand to let them manufacture with \n\ntheir  own  hands  whatever  they \nneed. Would they be thankful? \n\n36.  Glory  be  to  the  One  who  created  all \nkinds  of  plants  from  the  earth,  as \nwell  as  themselves,  and  other  crea- \ntions that they do not even know. \n37.  Another  sign  for  them  is  the  night: \nwe  remove  the  daylight  therefrom, \nwhereupon they are in darkness. \n38.  The  sun  sets  into  a  specific  location, \naccording  to  the  design  of  the  Al- \nmighty, the Omniscient. \n\n39.  The  moon  we  designed  to  appear  in \nstages,  until  it  becomes  like  an  old \ncurved sheath. \n\n40.  The  sun  is  never  to  catch  up  with  the \nmoon\u2014the  night  and  the  day  never \ndeviate\u2014each  of  them  is  floating  in \nits own orbit. \n\nInvention of the First Ship \n41.  Another  sign  for  them  is  that  we \ncarried  their  ancestors  on  the  load- \ned ark. \n\n42.  Then  created  the  same  for  them  to \n\nride in. \n\n43.  If  we  willed,  we  could  have  drowned \nthem,  so  that  their  screaming  would \nnot  be  heard,  nor  could  they  be \nsaved. \n\n44.  Instead,  we  shower  them  with  mer- \ncy, and let them enjoy for awhile. \n45.  Yet,  when  they  are  told,  \u201cLearn \nfrom  your  past,  to  work  righteous- \nness  for  your  future,  that  you  may \nattain mercy,\u201d \n\n*36:26 The righteous do not really die; they simply move on to the same Paradise where \nAdam & Eve lived. They join the prophets, saints and martyrs in an active and utopian \nlife (see App. 17). \n\n*36:30 If the messenger presents solid proof of messengership, advocates the worship of \nGod alone, and does not ask us for money, why should we not believe?

He has misled multitudes of you. \nDid you not possess any under- \nstanding? \n\n63.  This is the Hell that was promised \n\nfor you. \n\n64.  Today you will burn in it, as a con- \n\nsequence of your disbelief. \n\n65. On  that  day  we  will  seal  their \nmouths; their hands and feet will \nbear witness to everything they had \ndone. \n\n66.  If we will, we can veil their eyes and, \nconsequently, when they seek the \npath, they will not see. \n\n67.  If we will, we can freeze them in \nplace; thus, they can neither move \nforward, nor go back. \n\n68.  Whomever we permit to live for a \nlong time, we revert him to weak- \nness.

When  he  grew  enough  to  work  with \nhim,  he  said,  \u201cMy  son,  I  see  in  a \ndream  that  I  am  sacrificing  you. \nWhat  do  you  think?\u201d  He  said,  \u201cO  my \nfather,  do  what  you  are  commanded \nto do. You will find me, GOD will- \ning, patient.\u201d \n\n103.  They  both  submitted,  and  he  put  his \nforehead down (to sacrifice him). \n\nGod Intervenes \nto Save  \nAbraham and Ismail \n104.

We  ransomed  (Ismail)  by  substitut- \n\ning an animal sacrifice. \n\n108.  And  we  preserved  his  history  for \n\nsubsequent generations. \n109.  Peace be upon Abraham. \n110.

Most people who combine \ntheir properties treat each other un- \nfairly, except those who believe and \nwork righteousness, and these are \nso few.\u201d Afterwards, David won- \ndered if he made the right judgment. \nHe thought that we were testing \nhim.

We \nhave granted him a position of \nhonor  with  us,  and  a  beautiful \nabode. \n\n26.  O David, we have made you a ruler \non earth. Therefore, you shall judge \namong the people equitably, and do \nnot  follow your personal  opinion, \nlest it diverts you from the way of \nGOD. Surely, those who stray off the \nway of GOD incur severe retribu- \ntion for forgetting the Day of Reck- \noning. \n\n27.

We thus put Solomon to the test; \nwe blessed him with vast material \nwealth, but he steadfastly submit-\nted.* \n\n35.  He said, \u201cMy Lord, forgive me, and \ngrant me a kingship never attained \nby anyone else. You are the Gran- \ntor.\u201d \n\n36.  We (answered his prayer and) com- \nmitted  the  wind  at  his  disposal, \npouring rain wherever he wanted. \n37.  And the devils, building and diving. \n38.  Others were placed at his disposal. \n39.  \u201cThis is our provision to you; you \nmay give generously, or withhold, \nwithout limits.\u201d \n\n*38:24 In this clear example, 99 on one side vs. 1 on the other side, David\u2019s extreme care   \nto render the correct judgment caused him to ask forgiveness. Are we this careful? \n*38:32 Solomon missed his afternoon prayer because of his horses. To nullify Satan\u2019s \npossible claim that Solomon loved his horses more than loving God, he got rid of his \nhorses. \n\n*38:34 & 41 Solomon and Job represent both ends of the testing spectrum.

Absolutely,  He  is  the \nAlmighty, the Forgiving. \n\n6.  He  created  you  from  one  person, \nthen  created  from  him  his  mate.  He \nsent down to you eight kinds of live-\nstock.  He  creates  you  in  your  moth-\ners\u2019  bellies,  creation  after  creation, \nin  trimesters  of  darkness.  Such  is \nGOD  your  Lord.  To  Him  belongs  all \nsovereignty.  There  is  no  other  god \nbeside  Him.  How  could  you  de-\nviate? \n\nBelieve For Your Own Good \n7.  If  you  disbelieve,  GOD  does  not \nneed  anyone.  But  He  dislikes  to  see \nHis  servants  make  the  wrong  de-\ncision.  If  you  decide  to  be  apprecia-\ntive, He is pleased for you. No soul \nbears  the  sins  of  any  other  soul.  Ul-\ntimately,  to  your  Lord  is  your  return, \nthen  He  will  inform  you  of  every-\nthing  you  had  done.  He  is  fully \naware of the innermost thoughts. \n8.  When  the  human  being  is  afflicted, \nhe  implores  his  Lord,  sincerely \ndevoted  to  Him.  But  as  soon  as  He \nblesses  him,  he  forgets  his  previous \nimploring,  sets  up  idols  to  rank  with \nGOD  and  to  divert  others  from  His \npath.  Say,  \u201cEnjoy  your  disbelief \ntemporarily;  you  have  incurred  the \nhellfire.\u201d \n\n9.  Is  it  not  better  to  be  one  of  those \nwho meditate in the night, prostrating \nand  staying  up,  being  aware  of  the \nHereafter,  and  seeking  the  mercy  of \ntheir  Lord?  Say,  \u201cAre  those  who \nknow  equal  to  those  who  do  not \nknow?\u201d  Only  those  who  possess  in-\ntelligence will take heed. \n\n10.  Say,  \u201cO  My  servants  who  believed, \nyou  shall  reverence  your  Lord.\u201d  For \nthose  who  worked  righteousness  in \nthis  world,  a  good  reward.  GOD\u2019s \nearth  is  spacious,  and  those  who \nsteadfastly  persevere  will  receive \ntheir  recompense  generously,  with-\nout limits. \n\nGod ALONE \n\n11.  Say,  \u201cI  have  been  commanded  to \nworship  GOD,  devoting  the  religion \nabsolutely to Him alone. \n\n12.  \u201cAnd  I  was  commanded  to  be  the \n\nutmost submitter.\u201d \n\n13.  Say,  \u201cI  fear,  if  I  disobeyed  my  Lord, \n\nthe retribution of a great day.\u201d \n\n14.  Say,  \u201cGOD  is  the  only  One  I  wor-\nship,  devoting  my  religion  absolute-  \nly to Him alone. \n\n15.  \u201cTherefore,  worship  whatever  you \nwish  besides  Him.\u201d  Say,  \u201cThe  real \nlosers  are  those  who  lose  their  souls, \nand  their  families,  on  the  Day  of \nResurrection.\u201d  Most  certainly,  this \nis the real loss. \n\n16.  They  will  have  masses  of  fire on  top \nof  them,  and  under  them.  GOD  thus \nalerts  His  servants:  O  My  servants, \nyou shall reverence Me. \n\n*39:5 This verse clearly informs us that the earth is round. The Arabic for \u201cHe rolls\u201d \n(Yukawwir) is derived from the Arabic word for \u201cball\u201d (Kurah). Since the Earth is not \nexactly round, a specific reference to its shape is given in 79:30. The Quran is replete \nwith scientific information that became known to us centuries after the revelation of the \nQuran. See Appendix 20. \n  2131 \n\n 109812 \n\n \n\f"

The  skins  of  those  who \nreverence  their  Lord  cringe  there-\nfrom, then their skins and their \n\nThe Throngs (Al-Zumar) 39:17-32 \n\nhearts  soften  up  for  GOD\u2019s  mes-\nsage.  Such  is  GOD\u2019s  guidance;  He \nbestows  it  upon  whomever  He  wills. \nAs  for  those  sent  astray  by  GOD, \nnothing can guide them. \n\n24.  What  is  better  than  saving  one\u2019s \nface  from  the  terrible  retribution  on \nthe  Day  of  Resurrection?  The  trans-\ngressors  will  be  told,  \u201cTaste  the  con-\nsequences of what you earned.\u201d \n25.  Others  before  them  have  disbe-\nlieved  and,  consequently,  the  retri-\nbution  afflicted  them  whence  they \nnever expected. \n\n26.  GOD  has  condemned  them  to  hu-\nmiliation  in  this  life,  and  the  retribu-\ntion  in  the  Hereafter  will  be  far \nworse, if they only knew. \n\nQuran: No Ambiguity \n\n27.  We  have  cited  for  the  people  every \nkind  of  example  in  this  Quran,  that \nthey may take heed. \n\n28.  An  Arabic  Quran,  without  any  am-\nbiguity, that they may be righteous. \n29.  GOD  cites  the  example  of  a  man \nwho  deals  with  disputing  partners \n(Hadith),  compared  to  a  man  who \ndeals  with  only  one  consistent \nsource  (Quran).  Are  they  the  same? \nPraise  be  to  GOD;  most  of  them  do \nnot know. \n\nHadith: A Gross Blasphemy \n\n30.  You  (Muhammad)  will  surely  die, \n\njust like they will die. \n\n31.  On  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  before \nyour  Lord,  you  people  will  feud  with \none another. \n\n32.

GOD remits their sinful works, and \nrewards them generously for their \ngood works. \n\nProfound Question \n\n36.  Is GOD not sufficient for His ser-\nvant? They frighten you with the \nidols  they  set  up  beside  Him. \nWhomever GOD sends astray, noth-\ning can guide him. \n\n37.  And whomever GOD guides, noth-\ning can send him astray.

Have  they  invented  intercessors  to \nmediate between them and GOD? \nSay, \u201cWhat if they do not possess \nany power, nor understanding?\u201d \n44.

When GOD ALONE is  mentioned, \nthe  hearts  of  those  who  do  not \nbelieve in the Hereafter shrink with \naversion. But when others are men-\ntioned  beside  Him,  they  become \nsatisfied.* \n\n46.

The  heavens  above  them  almost \nshatter, out of reverence for Him, \nand the angels praise and glorify \ntheir Lord, and they ask forgiveness \nfor those on earth. Absolutely, GOD \nis the Forgiver, Most Merciful. \n6.  Those who set up other lords beside \nHim, GOD is the One in charge of \nthem; you are not their advocate. \n7.  We thus  reveal to  you an Arabic \nQuran to warn the central commu-\nnity and all around it, and to warn \nabout the Day of Summoning that is \ninevitable.  Some  will  end  up  in \nHeaven, and some in Hell. \n\n8.  Had  GOD  willed,  He  could  have \nmade them one community. But He \nredeems into His mercy whomever \nHe wills. As for the transgressors, \nthey have no master, nor a helper. \n9.  Did  they  find  other  lords  beside \nHim? GOD is the only Lord and \nMaster. He is the One who resur-\nrects the dead, and He is the Om-\nnipotent One. \n\n10. If you dispute any part of this mes-\nsage,  the  judgment  for  doing  this \nrests with GOD. Such is GOD my \n\nConsultation (Al-Shoor\u00e3) 42:1-14 \n\nLord. In Him I trust, and to Him I \nsubmit. \n\nNone Equals God \n\n11.  Initiator  of  the  heavens  and  the \nearth.

There is nothing that equals Him. \nHe is the Hearer, the Seer. \n\n12.  To Him belongs absolute control of \nthe heavens and the earth. He is the \nOne who increases the provision for \nwhomever He wills, or reduces it. \nHe is fully aware of all things. \n\nOnly One Religion \n\n13.  He  decreed  for  you  the  same  re-\nligion decreed for Noah, and what \nwe inspired to you, and what we \ndecreed for Abraham, Moses, and \nJesus: \u201cYou shall uphold this one \nreligion, and do not divide it.\u201d \n\nMonotheists  vs.  Idol  Worshipers \nThe  idol  worshipers  will  greatly \nresent what you invite them to do. \nGOD  redeems  to  Himself  whom-\never He wills; He guides to Himself \nonly those who totally submit. \n\n14.  Ironically, they broke up into sects \nonly after the knowledge had come \nto them, due to jealousy and resent-\nment among themselves.

If  He  willed,  He  could  have  stilled \nthe  winds,  leaving  them  motionless \non  top  of  the  water.  These  are \nproofs  for  those  who  are  steadfast, \nappreciative. \n\n34.  He  can  annihilate  them,  as  a  conse-\nquence  of  their  own  works.  Instead, \nHe overlooks many (of their sins). \n35.  Those  who  argue  against  our  proofs \nwill find out that they have no basis. \n36.  Whatever  you  are  given  is  no  more \nthan  temporary  material  of  this  life. \nWhat  GOD  possesses  is  far  better \nand  everlasting,  for  those  who  be-\nlieve and trust in their Lord. \n\nTraits of the Believers \n\n37.

When one of them is given news (of \na  daughter)  as  they  claimed  for  the \nMost  Gracious,  his  face  is  darkened \nwith misery and anger! \n\n18.

The  fact  is:  they  said,  \u201cWe  found \nour  parents  carrying  on  certain \npractices,  and  we  are  following  in \ntheir footsteps.\u201d \n\n23.  Invariably,  when  we  sent  a  warner \nto  any  community,  the  leaders  of \nthat  community  would  say,  \u201cWe \nfound  our  parents  following  certain \npractices,  and  we  will  continue  in \ntheir footsteps.\u201d \n\n24.  (The  messenger)  would  say,  \u201cWhat \nif  I  brought  to  you  better  guidance \nthan  what  you  inherited  from  your \nparents?\u201d  They  would  say,  \u201cWe  are \ndisbelievers  in  the  message  you \nbrought.\u201d \n\n25.  Consequently,  we  requited  them. \nNote  the  consequences  for  the  re-\njectors. \n\nAbraham\u2019s Example \n26.

This  example  (of  Abraham)  was \nrendered  an  everlasting  lesson  for \nsubsequent  generations;  perhaps \nthey redeem their souls. \n\n29.  Indeed,  I  have  given  these  people \nand  their  ancestors  sufficient  chan-\nces,  then  the  truth  came  to  them, \nand a clarifying messenger. \n\nMuhammad Ridiculed \n31.  They  said,  \u201cIf  only  this  Quran  was \nsent  down  through  another  man \nfrom  the  two  communities  (Mecca \nor Yathrib) who is prominent!\u201d \n32.  Are  they  the  ones  who  assign  your \nLord\u2019s  mercy?  We  have  assigned \ntheir  shares  in  this  life,  raising  some \nof  them  above  others  in  ranks,  in \norder  to  let  them  serve  one  another. \nThe  mercy  from  your  Lord  is  far \nbetter  than  any  material  they  may \nhoard. \n\nMaterials of This World:        \n\nAll That The Disbelievers Get \n33.  If  it  were  not  that  all  the  people \nmight  become  one  (disbelieving) \ncongregation,  we  would  have  grant-  \ned  everyone  who  disbelieves  in  the \nMost  Gracious  mansions  with  silver \nroofs,  and  stairs  upon  which  they \ncould climb. \n\n34.  Their  mansions  would  have  impres-\nsive  gates,  and  luxurious  furnish-\nings. \n\n35.  Also  many  ornaments.  All  these  are \nthe  temporary  materials  of  this \nlowly  life.

When  the  truth  came  to  them,  they \nsaid,  \u201cThis  is  magic,  and  we  are  dis-\nbelievers therein.\u201d \n\n37.

But  as  soon  as  we  relieved  their  af-\n\nfliction, they reverted. \n\n51.

He  thus  fooled  his  people,  and  they \nobeyed  him;  they  were  wicked  peo-\nple. \n\n55.  When  they  persisted  in  opposing  us, \nwe  punished  them  and  drowned \nthem all. \n\n56.  We  rendered  them  a  precedent  and \n\nan example for the others. \n\nJesus: Another Example \n57.  When  the  son  of  Mary  was  cited  as \nan  example,  your  people  disregard-  \ned it. \n\n58.

We  have  given  them  herein  clear \ncommandments.  Ironically,  they  did \nnot  dispute  this  until  the  knowledge \nhad  come  to  them.  This  is  due  to \njealousy  on  their  part.  Surely,  your \nLord  will  judge  them  on  the  Day  of \nResurrection \nregarding  everything \nthey have disputed. \n\n18.  We  then  appointed  you  to  establish \nthe  correct  laws;  you  shall  follow \nthis, and do not follow the wishes of \nthose who do not know. \n\n19.  They  cannot  help  you  at  all  against \nGOD.  It  is  the  transgressors  who  ally \nthemselves  with  one  another,  while \nGOD is the Lord of the righteous. \n20. This  provides  enlightenments  for \nthe  people,  and  guidance,  and  mer-  \ncy for those who are certain. \n\n21. Do  those  who  work  evil  expect  that \nwe  will  treat  them  in  the  same  man- \nner  as  those  who  believe  and  lead  a \nrighteous  life?  Can  their  life  and \ntheir  death  be  the  same?*  Wrong \nindeed is their judgment. \n\n22. GOD  created  the  heavens  and  the \nearth for a specific purpose, in \n\norder  to  pay  each  soul  for  whatever    \nit  earned,  without  the  least  injus-       \ntice.* \n\n Common Form of Idolatry:     \nThe Ego As A god \n23.  Have  you  noted  the  one  whose  god \nis  his  ego?  Consequently,  GOD \nsends  him  astray,  despite  his  knowl-\nedge,  seals  his  hearing  and  his  mind, \nand  places  a  veil  on  his  eyes.  Who \nthen  can  guide  him,  after  such  a \ndecision  by  GOD?  Would  you  not \ntake heed? \n\n24.  They  said,  \u201cWe only live this life; we \nlive  and  die  and  only  time  causes  our \ndeath!\u201d  They  have  no  sure  knowl-\nedge  about  this;  they  only  conjec-\nture. \n\n25.  When  our  revelations  are  recited  to \nthem,  clearly,  their  only  argument  is \nto  say,  \u201cBring  back  our  forefathers, \nif you are truthful.\u201d \n\n26.  Say,  \u201cGOD  has  granted  you  life, \nthen  He  puts  you  to  death,  then  He \nwill  summon  you  to  the  Day  of \nResurrection,  which  is  inevitable. \nBut most people do not know.\u201d \n27.  To  GOD  belongs  all  sovereignty  of \nthe  heavens  and  the  earth.  The  day \nthe  Hour  (Judgment)  comes  to  pass, \nthat is when the falsifiers lose. \n\nKneeling \n\n28. You  will  see  every  community \nkneeling.  Every  community  will  be \ncalled  to  view  their  record.  Today, \nyou  get  paid  for  everything  you  have \ndone. \n\n*45:21 We now realize that the righteous do not really die\u2014they go straight to Heaven \n(16:32)\u2014while the unrighteous are beaten up by the angels of death (8:50 & 47:27). \n\n*45:22 God granted us this life as a precious chance to redeem ourselves, denounce our \nancient alliance with Satan, and rejoin God\u2019s kingdom.

We have been recording \neverything you did. \n\n30.  As for those who believe and work \nrighteousness,  their  Lord  will  admit \nthem into His mercy. This is the \ngreat triumph. \n\n31.  As for those who disbelieve: \u201cWere \nnot My revelations recited to you, \nbut  you  turned  arrogant  and  were \nwicked people?\u201d \n\n32.

Your abode is \nthe hellfire, and you will have no \nhelpers. \n\n35.  \u201cThis is because you took GOD\u2019s \nrevelations in vain, and were preoc-\ncupied with the  first life.\u201d Conse-\nquently, they will never exit there-\nfrom, nor will they be excused. \n36.

The  revelation  of  this  scripture  is \nfrom  GOD,  the  Almighty,  Most \nWise. \n\n3.  We did not create the heavens and \nthe earth, and everything between \nthem except for a specific purpose, \nand for a finite interim. Those who \ndisbelieve are totally oblivious to the \nwarnings given to them. \n\n4.  Say, \u201cConsider the idols you have \nset up beside GOD. Show me what \non earth did they create. Do they \nown part of the heavens? Show me \nany other scripture before this one, \nor any piece of established knowl-\nedge that supports your idolatry, if \nyou are truthful.\u201d \n\nThe Idols Totally Unaware \n\n5.

Surely, those who say, \u201cOur Lord is \nGOD,\u201d then lead a righteous life, \n\nwill have no fear, nor will they \ngrieve. \n\n14. They  have  deserved  Paradise, \nwhere they abide forever; a reward \nfor their works. \n\n40: The Age of Decision* \n\n15.  We  enjoined  the  human  being  to \nhonor his parents. His mother bore \nhim arduously, gave birth to him ar-\nduously, and took intimate care of \nhim  for  thirty  months.  When  he \nreaches  maturity, and reaches the \nage of forty,* he should say, \u201cMy \nLord, direct me to appreciate the \nblessings You have bestowed upon \nme and upon my parents, and to do \nthe  righteous  works  that  please \nYou. Let my children be righteous \nas well. I have repented to You; I am \na submitter.\u201d \n\n16.  It is from these that we accept the \nrighteous works, and overlook their \nsins. They have deserved Paradise. \nThis is the truthful promise that is \npromised to them. \n\n17.  Then there is the one who says to his \nparents, \u201cWoe to you; are you telling \nme that (after death) I will come \nback to life? How come those who \ndied before us never come back?\u201d \nThe parents would cry for GOD\u2019s \nhelp and say, \u201cWoe to you; please \nbelieve! GOD\u2019s promise is the \ntruth.\u201d He would say, \u201cTales from \nthe past!\u201d \n\n18.  Such are the ones stamped as dis-\nbelievers among every generation of \njinns and humans; they are losers. \n\n*46:10 This witness is Rabbi Judah the Pious (11th Century A.D.), who discovered the \nsame 19-based mathematical code in intact fragments of the scripture (see Appendix \n1). \n*46:15 God knows full well who deserves to go to Heaven and who deserves to go to \nHell. It is His law that whomever He puts to death before the age of 40 shall go to Heaven. \nGod\u2019s immense mercy is reflected in the fact that most people have difficulty accepting \nthis divine mercy; they argue: \u201cPut them in Hell!\u201d See Appendix 32. \n2304 \n\n  114483 \n\n \n\f"

But  their  hearing,  eyes, \nand  minds  did  not  help  them  at  all. \nThis  is  because  they  decided  to  dis-\nregard  GOD\u2019s  revelations.  Thus,  the \nprophecies  and  warnings  that  they \nridiculed have caused their doom. \n27.  We  have  annihilated  many  commu-\nnities  around  you,  after  we  had  ex-\nplained  the  proofs,  that  they  might \nrepent. \n\n28.  Why  then  did  the  idols  they  set  up \nto  bring  them  closer  to  GOD  fail  to \nhelp  them?  Instead,  they  aban-\ndoned  them.

Whereby  GOD  forgives  your  past \nsins, as well as future sins, and per-\nfects His blessings upon you, and \nguides you in a straight path. \n\n3. Additionally, GOD will support you \n\nwith an unwavering support. \n\n4. He is the One who places content-\nment into the hearts of believers to \naugment more faith, in addition to \ntheir faith. To GOD belongs all for-\nces of the heavens and the earth. \nGOD is Omniscient, Most Wise. \n5. He will certainly admit the believing \nmen and women into gardens with \nflowing streams, wherein they abide \nforever.  He  will  remit  their  sins. \nThis is, in the sight of GOD, a great \ntriumph. \n\n6. And  He  will  requite  the  hypocrite \nmen and women and the idol wor-\nshiping men and women, for they \nhave harbored evil  thoughts about \nGOD.  Their  evil  will  backfire  a-\ngainst them. For GOD is angry with \nthem,  condemns  them,  and  has \nprepared for them Gehenna.  What \na miserable destiny! \n\n7. To GOD belongs all the forces in \nthe heavens and the earth. GOD is \nAlmighty, Most Wise. \n\nVictory (Al-Fatt-h) 48:1-13 \n\n8.  We have sent you as a witness, a \nbearer of good news, and a warner. \n9.  That  you  people  may  believe  in \nGOD and His messenger, and rev-\nerence Him, and observe Him, and \nglorify Him, day and night. \n\n You Shall Support \nGod\u2019s Messenger \n\n10.  Surely, those who pledge allegiance \nto you, are pledging allegiance to \nGOD. GOD approves their pledge; \nHe  places  His  hand  above  their \nhands. Those who violate such a \npledge, commit the violation to their \nown detriment. As for those who \nfulfill their pledge with GOD, He \nwill grant them a great recompense. \n11.  The sedentary Arabs who stay be-\nhind will say, \u201cWe have been preoc-\ncupied  with  our  money  and  our \nfamilies, so ask forgiveness for us!\u201d \nThey utter with their tongues what \nis not in their hearts. Say, \u201cWho can \nprotect you from GOD, if He willed \nany adversity for you, or if He willed \nany blessing for you?\u201d GOD is fully \nCognizant of everything you do. \n12.  You secretly believed that the mes-\nsenger and the believers will be \ndefeated and never come back to \ntheir families, and this was firmly \nestablished in your hearts. You har-\nbored evil thoughts and turned into \nwicked people. \n\n13.

The  sedentary  who  stay  behind  will \nsay,  when  you  are  expected  to  col-\nlect spoils of war, \u201cLet us follow you \nto  share  in  this!\u201d  They  thus  wish  to \nalter  GOD\u2019s  words.

Say  to  the  sedentary  Arabs  who  stay \nbehind,  \u201cYou  will  be  invited  to  face \npowerful  people  and  to  fight  them, \nunless  they  submit.  If  you  obey, \nGOD  will  reward  you  with  a  gen-\nerous  recompense.

The  blind  is  not  to  be  blamed,  the \ncrippled  is  not  to  be  blamed,  and  the \nsick  is  not  to  be  blamed.  Those  who \nobey  GOD  and  His  messenger,  He \nwill  admit  them  into  gardens  with \nflowing  streams.  As  for  those  who \nturn  away,  He  will  requite  them  with \na painful retribution. \n\n18.  GOD  is  pleased  with  the  believers \nwho  pledged  allegiance  to  you  un-\nder  the  tree.  He  knew  what  was  in \ntheir  hearts  and,  consequently,  He \nblessed  them  with  contentment,  and \nrewarded  them  with  an  immediate \nvictory. \n\n19.  Additionally,  they  gained  many \nspoils.  GOD  is  Almighty,  Most \nWise. \n\n20.  GOD  has  promised  you  many  spoils \nthat  you  will  gain.  He  thus  advanced \nsome benefits  for  you in this  life, and \nHe  has  withheld  the  people\u2019s  hands \nof  aggression  against  you,  and  has \nrendered  this  a  sign  for  the  believ- \ners.  He  thus  guides  you  in  a  straight \npath. \n\n21.  As  for  the  group  that  you  could  not \npossibly  defeat,  GOD  took  care  of \nthem; GOD is Omnipotent. \n\nVictory \nGuaranteed \nfor the Believers \n\n22.  If  the  disbelievers  ever  fought  you, \nthey  would  turn  around  and  flee. \nThey  have  no  Lord  and  Master;  they \nhave no helper. \n\n23.  Such  is  GOD\u2019s  system  throughout \nhistory,  and  you  will  find  that  GOD\u2019s \nsystem is unchangeable. \n\n24.  He   is the   One   who   withheld \ntheir  hands  of  aggression  against \nyou,  and  withheld  your  hands  of  ag-\ngression  against  them  in  the  valley  of \nMecca,  after  He  had  granted  you \nvictory  over  them.  GOD  is  Seer  of \neverything you do. \n\n25.  It  is  they  who  disbelieved  and  bar- \nred  you  from  the  Sacred  Masjid,  and \neven  prevented  your  offerings  from \nreaching  their  destination.  There \nwere  believing  men  and  women \n(within  the  enemy  camp)  whom  you \ndid  not  know,  and  you  were  about  to \nhurt  them,  unknowingly.

While  those  who  disbelieved  were \nenraged, and their hearts were filled \nwith the pride  of  the days of ig-\nnorance,  GOD  blessed  His  mes-\nsenger and the believers with peace-\nful  contentment,  and  directed  them \nto  uphold  the  word  of  righteous-\nness.  This  is  what  they  well  de-\nserved. GOD is fully aware of all \nthings. \n\n27.

You will \nnot have any fear. Since He knew \nwhat  you  did  not  know,  He  has \ncoupled this with an immediate vic-\ntory.\u201d \n\nThe Great Prophecy* \n\n28. He is the  One who sent  His  mes-\nsenger  with  the  guidance  and  the \nreligion of truth, to make it prevail \nover all other religions. GOD suf-\nfices as a witness.* \n\nQualities of the Believers \n\n29.  Muhammad\u2014the  messenger  of \nGOD\u2014and  those  with  him  are \nharsh and stern against the disbe-\nlievers, but kind and compassionate \namongst themselves. You see them \nbowing and prostrating, as they seek \nGOD blessings and approval. Their \n\nmarks are on their faces, because of \nprostrating. This is the same exam-\nple as in the Torah. Their example \nin the Gospel is like plants that grow \ntaller and stronger, and please the \nfarmers.  He  thus  enrages  the  dis-\nbelievers.  GOD  promises  those \namong them who believe and lead a \nrighteous  life  forgiveness  and  a \ngreat recompense. \n               \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 \n\nSura 49: The Walls \n(Al-Hujur\u00e3t) \nIn the name of God,     \n\nMost Gracious, Most Merciful \n\n1.  O you who believe, do not place \nyour opinion above that of GOD and \nHis messenger. You shall reverence \nGOD. GOD is Hearer, Omniscient. \n2.  O you who believe, do not raise your \nvoices above the voice of the proph-\net,* nor shall you shout at him as you \nshout at each other, lest your works \nbecome nullified while you do not \nperceive. \n\n3.  Surely, those who lower their voices \nat the messenger of GOD are the \nones whose hearts are prepared by \nGOD to become righteous.* They \nhave deserved forgiveness and a \ngreat recompense. \n\n*48:28  This  important  prophecy  informs  us  that  Submission  will  inevitably  dominate           \nthe  whole  world.  This,  together  with  Verses  9:33,  41:53,  and  61:9  leave  no  doubt  that     \nGod\u2019s mathematical  miracle of  the  Quran  will play a  major  role  in  this  prophecy. Solid \nQuranic  mathematical  evidence  points  to  God\u2019s  Messenger  of  the  Covenant  as  fulfilling     \nthis prophecy. See Appendices 2 & 26 for the evidence and specific details. \n\n*49:2  Whenever  the  word  \u201cprophet\u201d  (Nabi)  is  used  in  reference  to  Muhammad,  it    \ninvariably refers to him during his life, not after his death. Obviously, we cannot possibly \nraise our voices above Muhammad\u2019s voice, now that he is dead. See also 33:56. \n\n*49:3 Respecting the messenger helps outsiders and visitors in coming to God\u2019s message. \n2382 \n115494 \n\n \n\f"

Had  they  been  patient  until  you \ncame out to them, it would have \nbeen better for them. GOD is For- \ngiver, Most Merciful. \n\nInvestigate  Rumors  Before \nBelieving Them \n6. O you who believe, if a wicked per-\nson brings any news to you, you shall \nfirst investigate, lest you commit in-\njustice towards some people, out of \nignorance, then become sorry and \nremorseful for what you have done. \n7.

O you who believe, no people shall \nridicule other people, for they may \nbe better than they. Nor shall any \nwomen  ridicule  other  women,  for \nthey may be better than they. Nor \nshall  you  mock  one  another,  or \nmake fun of your names. Evil indeed \nis the reversion to wickedness after \nattaining  faith.  Anyone  who  does \nnot repent after this, these are the \ntransgressors. \n\nSuspicion Is Sinful \n12.  O you who believe, you shall avoid \nany suspicion, for even a little bit of \nsuspicion is sinful. You shall not spy \non one another, nor shall you back-\nbite one another; this is as abomin-\nable as eating the flesh of your dead \nbrother.  You  certainly  abhor  this. \nYou  shall  observe  GOD.  GOD  is \nRedeemer, Most Merciful. \n\nThe Only Criterion For \nDistinguishing Among The People \n13.  O people, we created you from the \nsame  male  and  female,  and  rend-\nered you distinct peoples and tribes, \nthat you may recognize one another. \nThe best among you in the sight of \nGOD is the most righteous. GOD is \nOmniscient, Cognizant. \n\nMuslim vs. Mu\u2019men \n\n14.

If \nyou cannot fast, then you shall feed \nsixty poor people. You shall believe \nin GOD and His messenger. These \nare GOD\u2019s laws. The disbelievers \nhave incurred a painful retribution. \n5.

They  con-\nspire  to  commit  sin,  transgression, \nand  disobedience  of  the  messenger. \nWhen  they  come  to  you,  they  greet \nyou  with  a  greeting  other  than  that \ndecreed  by  GOD.  They  say  inside \nthemselves,  \u201cGOD  will  not  punish \nus  for  our  utterances.\u201d  Their  only \nrequital  is  Gehenna,  wherein  they \nburn; what a miserable destiny. \n\n9.  O  you  who  believe,  if  you  have  to \nconfer  secretly,  you  shall  not  confer \nto  commit  sin,  transgression,  and  to \ndisobey  the  messenger.  You  shall \nconfer  to  work  righteousness  and \npiety.  You  shall  reverence  GOD, \nbefore  whom  you  will  be  summon- \ned. \n\n10.  Secret  conspiracy  is  the  devil\u2019s  idea, \nthrough  which  he  seeks  to  hurt  those \nwho  believed.  However,  he  cannot \nhurt  them  against  GOD\u2019s  will.  In \nGOD the believers shall trust. \n\n11.  O you who believe, if you  are told, \n\u201cPlease  make  room,\u201d  you  shall \nmake  room  for  each  other  to  sit. \nGOD  will  then  make  room  for  you. \nIf you are asked to get up and move, \n\nget  up  and  move.  GOD  raises  those \namong  you  who  believe,  and  those \nwho  acquire  knowledge  to  higher \nranks.  GOD  is  fully  Cognizant  of \neverything you do. \n\n12.  O  you  who  believe,  when  you  wish \nto  confer  with  the  messenger,  you \nshall  offer  a  charity  (to  the  poor) \nbefore  you  do  so.  This  is  better  for \nyou,  and  purer.  If  you  cannot  afford \nit,  then  GOD  is  Forgiver,  Most  Mer-\nciful. \n\n13.  If  you  failed  to  give  to  charity  before \nconferring,  then  repented  there-\nafter,  GOD  accepts  your  repen-\ntance.  You  shall  observe  the  contact \nprayers  (Salat),  give  the  obligatory \ncharity  (Zakat),  and  obey  GOD  and \nHis  messenger.  GOD  is  fully  Cog-\nnizant of everything you do. \n\nChoose Your Friends \n\n14.  Have  you  noted  those  who  be-\nfriended  people  with  whom  GOD  is \nangry?  They  neither  belong  with \nyou,  nor  with  them.  They  deliberate-    \nly swear lies! \n\n15.  GOD  has  prepared  for  them  a  se-\nvere  retribution.  Miserable  indeed \nis what they used to do. \n\n16.  They  used  their  oaths  as  a  means  of \nrepelling  from  the  path  of  GOD. \nConsequently,  they  have  incurred  a \nshameful retribution. \n\n17.  Neither  their  money,  nor  their  chil-\ndren  will  help  them  against  GOD. \nThey  have  incurred  the  hellfire, \nwherein they abide forever. \n\n18.  The  Day  will  come  when  GOD  re-\nsurrects  them  all.  They  will  swear  to \nHim  then,  just  as  they  swear  to  you \nnow,  thinking  that  they  really  are \nright! Indeed, they are the real liars. \n\n 2480 \n\n116647 \n\n \n \n\f"

You will not find people who believe \nin GOD and the Last Day befriend-\ning those who oppose GOD and His \nmessenger, even if they were their \nparents, or their children, or their \nsiblings, or their tribe. For these, He \ndecrees faith into their hearts, and \nsupports them with inspiration from \nHim, and admits them into gardens \nwith flowing streams wherein they \nabide forever. GOD is pleased with \nthem,  and  they  are  pleased  with \nHim.

Glorifying GOD is everything in the \nheavens and the earth, and He is the \nAlmighty, Most Wise. \n\nGod Defends the Believers \n\n2.  He is the One who evicted those \nwho disbelieved among the people \nof the scripture from their homes in \na mass exodus. You never thought \nthat they would leave, and they \nthought  that  their  preparations \nwould protect them from GOD. But \n\nthen  GOD  came  to  them  whence \nthey never expected, and threw ter-\nror  into  their  hearts.  Thus,  they \nabandoned  their  homes  on  their \nown volition, in addition to pressure \nfrom  the  believers.  You  should \nlearn from this, O you who possess \nvision. \n\n3.  If GOD did not force them to leave, \nHe would have requited them in this \nlife (even worse than forcing them to \nleave). In  the Hereafter He  will \ncommit them to the retribution of \nHell. \n\n4.  This is because they opposed GOD \nand His messenger. For those who \noppose  GOD  and  His  messenger, \nGOD is  most strict in enforcing \nretribution. \n\n5.  Whether you chop a tree, or leave it \nstanding on its trunk, is in accord-\nance with GOD\u2019s will. He will surely \nhumiliate the wicked. \n\n6.  Whatever  GOD  restored  for  His \nmessenger was not the result of your \nwar efforts, whether you fought on \nhorses or on foot. GOD is the One \nwho sends His messengers against \nwhomever He wills. GOD is Om-\nnipotent. \n\nThe Spoils of War \n\n7.  Whatever  GOD  restored  to  His \nmessenger from the (defeated) com-\nmunities shall go to GOD and His \nmessenger (in the form of a charity). \nYou shall give it to the relatives, the \norphans, the poor, and the traveling \nalien. Thus, it will not remain mo-\nnopolized by the strong among you. \nYou may keep the spoils given to \nyou by the messenger, but do not \ntake  what  he  enjoins  you  from \ntaking. You shall reverence GOD. \nGOD is strict in enforcing retribu-\ntion. \n\n   2504 \n\n116757 \n\n \n\f"

Indeed,  those \nwho  overcome  their  natural  stingi-\nness are the successful ones. \n\n10.

They  do  not  get  together  to  fight  you \nunless  they  are  in  well-shielded \nbuildings,  or  behind  walls.  Their \nmight  appears  formidable  among \nthemselves.  You  would  think  that \nthey  are  united,  when  in  fact  their \nhearts  are  divided.  This  is  because \nthey  are  people  who  do  not  under-\nstand. \n\n15.  Their  fate  is  the  same  as  their \ncounterparts  who  preceded  them. \nThey  suffered  the  consequences  of \ntheir  decisions.  They  have  incurred \na painful retribution. \n\n16.

O  you  who  believe,  you  shall  not \nbefriend My enemies and your ene-\nmies, extending love and friendship \nto them, even though they have dis- \n\nbelieved in the truth that has come \nto  you.  They  persecute  the  mes-\nsenger,  and  you,  just  because  you \nbelieve in GOD, your Lord. If you \nmobilize  to  struggle  in  My  cause, \nseeking My blessings, how can you \nsecretly love them? I am fully aware \nof everything you conceal, and ev-\nerything you declare. Those among \nyou who do this have indeed strayed \noff the right path. \n\n2.  Whenever they encounter you, they \ntreat you as enemies, and hurt you \nwith their hands and tongues. They \nwant you to disbelieve. \n\n3.  Your relatives and your money can \nnever help  you.  On  the  Day  of \nResurrection, He will judge among \nyou. GOD is Seer of everything you \ndo. \n\nAbraham: An Example \n4.  A good example has been set for you \nby Abraham and those with him. \nThey said to their people, \u201cWe dis-\nown you and the idols that you wor-\nship besides GOD. We denounce \nyou, and you will see nothing from \nus except animosity and hatred until \nyou  believe  in  GOD  ALONE.\u201d* \nHowever, a mistake was committed \nby Abraham when he said to his \nfather, \u201cI will pray for your forgive-\nness,**  but  I  possess  no  power \nto protect you from GOD.\u201d \u201cOur \nLord, we trust in You, and submit to \nYou; to You is the final destiny. \n\n*60:4 The Arabic word for \u201cALONE\u201d (WAHDAHU) occurs only six times in the Quran,      \none  of  them  refers  to  upholding  the  Quran  ALONE  (17:46).  The  reference  to  God \nALONE  occurs  in  7:70,  39:45,  40:12  &  84,  and  60:4.  The  sum  of  these  numbers          \n(7+70+39+45+40+12+84+60+4)  equals  361,  or  19x19.  This  emphasizes  that   \nthe main theme of the Quran is \u201cWorship God ALONE.\u201d See Appendix 1. \n\n**60:4 We can pray for guidance for the idolaters, not forgiveness, since God\u2019s law is \nthat idolatry is the only unforgivable offense (4:48 & 116). \n2523 \n\n 116940 \n\n\f"

This  \nis better for you, if you only knew. \n10.  Once  the  prayer  is  completed,  you \nmay  spread  through  the  land  to  seek \nGOD\u2019s  bounties,  and  continue  to \nremember  GOD  frequently,  that \nyou may succeed. \n\n11.  When  some  of  them  come  across  a \nbusiness  deal,  or  some  entertain-\nment,  they  rush  to  it  and  leave  you \nstanding!  Say,  \u201cWhat  GOD  posses- \nses  is  far  better  than  the  entertain-\nment  or  the  business.  GOD  is  the \nbest Provider.\u201d \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 \nSura 63: The Hypocrites \n(Al-Munaafeqoon) \nIn the name of God,        \nMost Gracious, Most Merciful \n\n1.  When  the  hypocrites  come  to  you \nthey  say,  \u201cWe  bear  witness  that  you \nare  the  messenger  of  GOD.\u201d*  GOD \nknows  that  you  are  His  messenger, \nand  GOD  bears  witness  that  the \nhypocrites are liars. \n\n2.  Under  the  guise  of  their  apparent \nfaith,  they  repel  the  people  from  the \npath  of  GOD.  Miserable  indeed  is \nwhat they do. \n\n*63:1 The \u201cfirst pillar of Islam,\u201d as stated in 3:18 is to bear witness that God is the only \ngod. But the corrupted \u201cMuslim\u201d scholars add \u201cMuhammad is God\u2019s messenger,\u201d and   \nthis violates a number of commandments (see 2:285). Verse 63:1 is the only place in  \nthe Quran where such a statement is made. Only the hypocrites make such a statement. \n\n2572 \n\n  117144 \n\n \n\f"
