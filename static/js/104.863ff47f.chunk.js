It was a well known fact that Dr. Khalifa would come every day in the early hours to carry on his work on this translation.","2":"By God\u2019s grace, he had completed his review of the majority of this translation, having finished through Sura 49 the evening before.

All of God\u2019s prophets have come to this world, and all the scriptures have been delivered. The time has come to purify and consolidate all the messages delivered by God\u2019s prophets into one message, and to proclaim that henceforth, there is only one religion acceptable to God, \u201cSubmission\u201d (3:19, 3:85). \u201cSubmission\u201d is the religion whereby we recognize God\u2019s absolute authority, and reach an unshakeable conviction that God ALONE possesses all power; no other entity possesses any power that is independent of Him. The natural result of such a realization is to devote our lives and our worship absolutely to God ALONE. This is the First Commandment in all the scriptures, including the Old Testament, the New Testament, and this Final Testament.

There may be \\nSubmitters who are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or anything else. These Submitters, collectively, constitute the only religion acceptable to God. As emphasized by the theme on the front page of this book, all Submitters who are devoted to God ALONE, and do not set up any idols beside God, are redeemed  into God\u2019s eternal kingdom (2:62). A criterion of the true submitters is that they will  \\nfind nothing objectionable in the Quran. ","5":"With the advent of this Testament, God\u2019s message to the world is now complete.

What  about  all  the  people  since  Adam  who  did  not  receive  the complete  scripture?\u201d  Bearing  in  mind  that  the  Quran  answers  this  question  in  20:52, it  is  a  matter  of  simple  statistics  that  the  world\u2019s  population  from  the  beginning  until now  did  not  exceed  7,000,000,000. From  now  to  the  end  of  the  world,  2280  A.D. (Appendix  25), it is estimated that the total world population will exceed 75,000,000,000. Thus, the vast majority of people are destined to receive God\u2019s purified and consolidated message (see diagram). ","3":"It  all  began  billions  of  years  ago  when  one  of  God\u2019s  high-ranking  creatures, Satan,  developed  a  supercilious  idea  that  he  could  run  a  dominion  as  an  independent god  besides  God.  This  challenge  to  God\u2019s  absolute  authority  was  not  only  blasphemous,  it  was  also  erroneous.  Satan  was  ignorant  of  the  fact  that  God  alone possesses  the  ability  to  be  a  god,  and  that  there  is  much  more  to  godhood  than  he realized.  It  was  the  ego\u2014arrogance  augmented  by  ignorance\u2014that  led  Satan  to  believe  that  he  could  take  care  of  a  dominion,  as  a  god,  and  run  it  without  disease, misery,  war, accidents, and  chaos. The  vast  majority  of  God\u2019s  creatures disagreed with Satan. Yet, the minute  egotistic  minority  that  agreed  with  him  to  various  extents were  in  the  billions.  Thus, a profound dispute  erupted  within  the Heavenly Community (38:69). The rebels\u2019 unjustifiable challenge to God\u2019s  absolute  authority  was met and resolved in the most efficient manner. After giving the rebels sufficient chances to denounce their crime and submit to Him, God decided to exile the hard core rebels on a space ship called Earth, and give them yet another chance to redeem themselves. ","4":"If you claim that you can fly a plane, the best way to test your claim is to give you a plane and ask you to fly it. This is precisely what God decided to do in response to  Satan\u2019s  claim  that  he  could  be  a  god;  God  appointed  him  a  temporary  god  on  the  tiny  speck  Earth  (2:30,  36:60).  As for  those  who  agreed  with  Satan,  they were  given  a  chance  to  kill  their  egos  and  submit  to  God\u2019s  absolute  authority.  While  the  vast  majority  of  the  guilty  creatures  took  advantage  of  this  opportunity,  a  minuscule  minority  consisting  of  about  150  billion  creatures  failed  to  take  advantage  of  this offer (33:72).","5":"xiv"},"evidence":{"2":{"lines":{"1":"World population from now (1990) to the end of the world (2280).","2":"The black section represents the world population since Adam"},"ref":["20:52"],"special":{"key":1,"data":[7,77]}}},"titles":{"1":"Before Genesis"}},{"page":15,"text":{"1":"The dispute in the Heavenly Community led to the classification of God\u2019s creatures into different categories: ","2":"Creatures who never questioned God\u2019s absolute authority were classified as angels; they knew that God alone possesses the ability and qualifications to be a god. The vast majority of God\u2019s creatures\u2014countless numbers\u2014belong in this category. The number of the angels is so enormous, even the angels do not know how many \\nof them there are; only God knows their number (74:31). ","3":"Although the angels suggested that the rebels and their leader should be exiled from God\u2019s kingdom (2:30), the Most Merciful willed to give the rebels a chance to denounce  their  crime,  repent,  and  submit  to  His  absolute  authority  (33:72).  As represented in the diagram above, the vast majority of the rebels took advantage of God\u2019s gracious offer to re-enter His kingdom. They agreed to kill their egos, come to this world to perform a submissive role, as an expiation for their blasphemy. In return for their submissive role in this world, these creatures are redeemed back to God\u2019s eternal kingdom (6:38). The horse, the dog, the tree, the sun, the moon, the stars, as well as deformed and retarded children are among the intelligent creatures who denounced their crime and repented: ","5":"The horse has no ego.

These egotistic creatures who failed to submit to God\u2019s absolute authority, even when offered a chance to do so, were divided in half. The half that were less convinced of Satan\u2019s point of view became classified as humans. Although they harbored doubts about Satan\u2019s claim, they failed to make a firm stand regarding God\u2019s absolute authority. It is the ego that prevented these creatures from appreciating God\u2019s omnipotence, it is the ego that prevented them from submitting when such an opportunity was offered to them (33:72), and it is the ego that stands between most of us and redemption to God\u2019s kingdom (25:43). This is why \u201cKill your ego\u201d is one of the first commandments in the Quran (2:54).","2":"The other half of the guilty creatures, those who leaned closer to Satan\u2019s point of view and exhibited the biggest egos, became classified as jinns. It was God\u2019s plan to assign one jinn to every human being from birth to death. The jinn companion represents Satan and constantly promotes his point of view (50:23, 50:27). Both the jinns and the humans are given a precious chance in this world to re-educate themselves, denounce their egoism, and redeem themselves by submitting to God\u2019s absolute authority. Whenever a human being is born, a jinn is born and is assigned to the new human. We learn from the Quran that the jinns are Satan\u2019s descendants (7:27, 18:50). When a jinn being is born and assigned to a human being, the jinn remains a constant companion of the human until the human dies. The jinn is then freed, and lives on for a few centuries. Both humans and jinns are required to worship God alone (51:56).","3":"The dispute in the Heavenly Community as stated in 38:69 and described above proves that God\u2019s creatures possess the freedom of choice; they have minds of their own. The rebellion of a minuscule minority among God\u2019s creatures has served to emphasize the wonderful fact that God\u2019s creatures serve Him because they appreciate His infinite magnificence. Without the rebellion, we would have never known that freedom is God\u2019s gift to His creatures.","4":"Even in our worldly dimension, any enterprise expects its employees to be loyal and devoted to the welfare of the enterprise. If an employee is not totally dedicated to the enterprise, or is shown to have divided loyalties, he is immediately dismissed. Since the humans and the jinns sided with Satan, then turned down God\u2019s offer to reconsider their rebellious acts, the angels expected Satan and his allies to be banished from God\u2019s kingdom (2:30). It was immense mercy from God that He granted us this additional chance to denounce our crime and redeem ourselves.","5":"xvi"},"evidence":{},"titles":{"1":"(3) The Humans","2":"(4) The Jinns","3":"God Does Not Want Robots","4":"Most Gracious, Most Merciful"}},{"page":17,"text":{"1":"To carry out this extremely merciful plan of redemption, God \u201ccreated death\u201d (67:1-2). The divine plan called for bringing the rebels into another existence, where hey have no recollection of the heavenly feud. Under the circumstances of this life, the humans and the jinns receive both God\u2019s messages and Satan\u2019s messages, then freely choose either side. Based on their freewill decision, they are either redeemed to God\u2019s kingdom, or become permanently exiled with Satan.","2":"To emphasize the utter insignificance of Satan\u2019s projected dominion, God created a billion galaxies, a billion trillion stars, within a vast universe that spans billions of light years. If we travel towards the sun (93,000,000 miles) at the speed of light, we will reach it in eight minutes. If we keep going, we will reach the border of our Milky Way Galaxy after 50-70,000 years at the speed of light. To reach the nearest galaxy, it will take us 2,000,000 years at the speed of light, and there are at least 2,000,000,000 galaxies in \u201cour universe.\u201d With the most powerful telescopes, the earth is utterly invisible from the edge of our own galaxy, let alone from the edge of our universe. As if our universe were not vast enough, God created six more, even larger universes surrounding our universe (2:29, 67:3). God then informed Satan that a tiny mote within the smallest and innermost universe, the planet Earth, shall be his dominion. God\u2019s plan called for placing the humans and jinns in a universe that cannot stand His physical presence (7:143). Thus, Satan rules his minute kingdom far from the physical presence of God, though with God\u2019s full knowledge and control. It should also be noted that the number of rebels who repented was so vast, that the planet earth could not possibly accommodate all of them. As it is, the animals vastly outnumber the humans on this planet. It would take an unmanagable earth to accommodate all the repentant rebels. Hence the placement of uncountable decillions of creatures in outer space.","3":"The body of the first human being was shaped on earth by God\u2019s angels, in accordance with God\u2019s instructions (7:11). God then assigned the first person, Adam, to that body. When God informed the angels that they will be serving the humans throughout the test period\u2014guarding them, driving the winds, distributing the rain and provisions, etc.\u2014Satan was the only one who refused to \u201cfall prostrate\u201d (2:34, 15:31, 38:74). Adam\u2019s mate was cloned, with feminine features, from Adam, and God assigned the second human being to her body. While the empty (soulless) bodies of Adam and Eve remained here on earth, their souls, the real persons, resided in Heaven. Adam and Eve remained in Heaven for as long as they upheld God\u2019s commandments. Once they listened to Satan instead, they reflected a flawed human nature in all of us, and they immediately belonged to Satan\u2019s dominion down on Earth\u2014\u201ctheir bodies became visible to them\u201d (7:20, 20:121). The rest is history.","4":"xvii"},"evidence":{},"titles":{"2":"Satan\u2019s Temporary Dominion","3":"Adam and Eve"}},{"page":18,"text":{"1":"Putting the jinns and the humans to the test stipulated that Satan shall reproduce whenever a human being is born. As mentioned above, every time a human being is born, a jinn being is born to serve as a constant companion of the human person. Every human being is subjected to the incessant persuasions of Satan\u2019s representative who lives in the same body from birth to death. Satan\u2019s representative tries to convince the human companion of Satan\u2019s point of view: that God alone is not enough. On the Day of Judgment, the jinn companion serves as a witness against the human counterpart (43:38, 50:23, 50:27). Many jinn companions are converted to God\u2019s point of view by the human companions.","2":"God did not leave the human being without preparation. To help the humans in their final chance to reconsider their blasphemy, every person is born with instinctive knowledge that God ALONE, and no one else, is our Lord and Master (7:172-173). The jinns were not given this instinctive knowledge, but they are given a much longer life span and greater abilities to study God\u2019s signs throughout the innermost universe. Since they represent Satan\u2019s point of view, their instinctive nature leans strongly in favor of polytheism. In addition to our built-in instinct to worship God alone, God sent messengers to help us redeem ourselves. With all these elements in view, we can appreciate the fact that the only unforgivable offense (if maintained until death) is idol worship: believing that anyone besides God possesses any power.","3":"The human being is given forty years to study, look around, reflect, and examine all points of view before making this most important decision\u2014to uphold Satan\u2019s point of view, or God\u2019s absolute authority. Anyone who dies before the age of forty is chosen by God for redemption due to circumstances known only to God. Anyone who dies before the age of 40 goes to Heaven (46:15, Appendix 32). God\u2019s immense mercy is evident from the fact that even those who believe in the Quran find it difficult to accept such a compassionate divine law.","4":"God\u2019s messengers delivered the good news of our God-given chance to redeem ourselves, and they were supported by formidable signs. When Moses went to Pharaoh, he was supported by such miracles as the turning of his staff into a serpent. Jesus created live birds from clay by God\u2019s leave, healed the leprous and the blind by God\u2019s leave, and revived the dead by God\u2019s leave. The prophet Muhammad, God\u2019s messenger who delivered this Final Testament, did not exhibit such miracles (10:20). The Quran itself was the miracle supporting Muhammad\u2019s mission (29:50-51). It was divine wisdom that separated the Miracle of the Quran from Muhammad by 14 centuries. Now that we understand the momentous dimensions of the Quran\u2019s mathematical miracle (Appendix 1), we realize that millions of people would have worshiped Muhammad as God incarnate if this Miracle were revealed through him.","5":"With the advent of the computer age, we discover that the Quran\u2019s mathematical code is \u201cOne of the great miracles\u201d as stated in 74:30-35. While the miracles given to previous messengers were limited in time and place, the Quran\u2019s miracle is perpetual. Only a few people witnessed the miracles of Moses and Jesus, but the Quran\u2019s miracle can be witnessed by anyone at any time. Furthermore, the Quran\u2019s miracle documents and proves all the previous miracles (5:48).","6":"xviii"},"evidence":{},"titles":{"2":"Satan: Father of All the Jinns","4":"Forty Years Grace Period","5":"Proof of Authenticity:\\nPhysical, Tangible, Irrefutable."}},{"page":19,"text":{"1":"As detailed in Appendix 1, the Quran\u2019s mathematical miracle is based on the number \u201c19.\u201d To share this awesome miracle with the reader, the word \u201cGOD\u201d is printed throughout the English text in bold capital letters and the cumulative number of occurrences is shown at the lower left corner of every page.
